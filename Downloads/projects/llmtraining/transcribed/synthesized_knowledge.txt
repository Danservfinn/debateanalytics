Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering. The book opens with the story of Bach's Musical
Offering. Bach made an impromptu visit to King Frederick the Great of Prussia, and was
requested to improvise upon a theme presented by the King. His improvisations formed the basis
of that great work. The Musical Offering and its story form a theme upon which I "improvise"
throughout the book, thus making a sort of "Metamusical Offering". Self-reference and the
interplay between different levels in Bach are discussed: this leads to a discussion of parallel
ideas in Escher's drawings and then G�del’s Theorem. A brief presentation of the history of logic
and paradoxes is given as background for G�del’s Theorem. This leads to mechanical reasoning
and computers, and the debate about whether Artificial Intelligence is possible. I close with an
explanation of the origins of the book-particularly the why and wherefore of the Dialogues.
Three-Part Invention. Bach wrote fifteen three-part inventions. In this three-part Dialogue, the
Tortoise and Achilles-the main fictional protagonists in the Dialogues-are "invented" by Zeno (as
in fact they were, to illustrate Zeno's paradoxes of motion). Very short, it simply gives the flavor
of the Dialogues to come.
Chapter I: The MU-puzzle. A simple formal system (the MIL'-system) is presented, and the reader
is introduced to the MU-puzzle. The MU-puzzle is a paradox in the foundations of mathematics,
which is solved by the introduction of a new constant symbol.
Two-Part Invention. The reader is introduced to the two-part invention of the Dialogues. The
first part is a narrative, and the second part is a musical score. The narrative is a
self-referential narrative, and the score is a self-referential musical composition.
Chapter II: Meaning and Form in Mathematics. The reader is introduced to the concept of meaning
and form in mathematics. The reader is also introduced to the concept of a "meaningless"
expression.
Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles. A sonata for unaccompanied Achilles is presented, which
is a self-referential piece of music. The reader is asked to identify the meaning of the
music.
Chapter III: Figure and Ground. The reader is introduced to the concept of "figure" and "ground"
in mathematics. The reader is also introduced to the concept of a "meaningless" expression.
