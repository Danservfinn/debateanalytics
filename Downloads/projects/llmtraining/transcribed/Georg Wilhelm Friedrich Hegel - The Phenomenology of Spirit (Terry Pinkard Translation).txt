peopletoeachother.LikeKantbeforehim,Hegelofferedupasys-
tematicaccountofthenatureofknowledge,theinfluenceofsociety

agency itself. A bold new understanding of what, after Hegel, came
to be called “subjectivity” arose from this work, and it was instru-

ashis“voyageofdiscovery.”Itwasinthatwork,Hegel’sfirstpublishedver-
sion of his own systematic views, that Hegel, a virtually unknown, barely
employed academic figure in Jena, became Hegel, the philosopher cele-
brated all over Europe. Nonetheless, however much of a voyage the book
was for him, it was by no means an easy passage. Published in April of
1807,itwasaworkwrittenhurriedlywhileHegelwasinextremelydirecir-
cumstances. He was thirty-seven when the Phenomenology appeared, and
during its composition he had no tenable job, no real prospects, and an

Hegeldidnotoriginallysetouttobeaphilosopher.1Whenhegraduated
fromTübingen’sfamousTheologicalSeminaryin1793,hiscareerpathhad
supposedly already been set for him. He was supposed, and in one sense
even obligated, to become a Lutheran pastor in the duchy of Württem-
berg. He rejected that option while he was at Tübingen, and quite fortu-
natelyforhim,atleastasfarashewasconcerned,thenumberofpositions
available for pastors were about as few as those for university professors,
ensuringthatthematterwouldneverreallycometoahead.AttheSemi-
nary,hehadstruckupaclosefriendshipandsharedaroomwithtwoother
students who had equally decided against the destiny chosen for them of
becoming pastors: Friedrich Hölderlin, who was to become one of Ger-
many’sgreatestpoets,andF.W.J.Schelling,whowasalsotobecomeone
of Germany’s greatest philosophers. Each of the three Tübingen friends

whatwasneeded in philosophy wereseverely misguided, and itwas there
that he began to entertain the idea of seeking a position as a university
professorofphilosophy.
After leaving the Seminary, Schelling himself had gone on to become

position at Jena was an unpaid one (although he was allowed to charge a
pittance for admission to his lectures, which was the accepted practice at
the time), and his financial support was almost entirely due to his small
inheritance. He was at first taken by the intellectual world to be simply a
discipleofSchelling,andhisfirstfewpublishedmonographswerewidely
taken to be mere variations if not simple iterations on the Schellingian
program in philosophy. When Schelling left Jena to assume a position in

TheIntellectual,Political,andSocialFermentoftheTime
Twomajordevelopmentsduringthisperiodshouldbekeptinmind.First,
there was the French Revolution of 1789 which had upended all con-
ventional thought in Europe. While at Tübingen, Schelling, Hegel, and
Hölderlin had in fact all been excited by the prospects in France. (Hegel
was a nineteen-year-old Seminary student studying philosophy when the
Revolutionhappened,andsomeofhiscompatriotsandfriendsatthetime
inTübingenactuallywenttofightonthesideoftheRevolution.Whilestill
at Tübingen, Schelling even translated the “Marseillaise” into German.)
The reactionary German powers had tried to suppress the revolution in
Francebuthadatgreatcostbeendefeatedseveraltimes.Throughoutthis
period,thefearofaFrench-stylerevolutionandtheinstitutionofaJacobin
reignofterrorwasneverfarfromthemindsoftherulingGermanpowers,
and the rise to power on the part of Napoleon in 1799, followed by his
coronation as Emperor of the French in 1804, did nothing to allay those
fears. In 1806, as Hegel was finishing up his work on the Phenomenology,
thePrussiansandtheiralliesoncemoretriedtoteachtheFrenchalesson,
and in response Napoleon sent his armies into German territory to meet
up with them. It was in fact at Jena on October 14 that the decisive bat-
tle took place, and Napoleon and his army delivered a crippling blow to
the Prussian army, sending the whole Prussian force into wild retreat in a
matter of only about thirty minutes. Hegel was later to claim that he fin-
ished the writing of the book under the sound of the cannon fire of the
battleitself,andthatratherboastfulclaimbecameitselfpartoftheHegel
legend.
xii Introduction
The second thing that must be kept in mind was the intellectual
upheaval brought about by Immanuel Kant’s writings. Starting with the
Critique of Pure Reason in 1781, Kant had effectively revolutionized phi-
losophy and repositioned the philosophical faculty as the leading edge
of what was turning out to be a complete reform of the German, and
later the entire European, and even still later, the entire worldwide uni-
versitysystem.Kant’scloselyrelatedclaimsthat“freedom”wasthewatch-
word of his system and that the meaning of the movement known as the
“Enlightenment”wasthatoflearningto“thinkforoneself”hadgalvanized
an entire generation of intellectuals. Kant’s related claims – that nothing
could count as morally or politically legitimate except that which issued
from the autonomous, self-determining wills of individuals, and that the
willsofsuchindividualswereautonomoustothedegreethattheyfollowed
rationally self-determined laws – together articulated a widely felt experi-
ence in European youth at the time. In his three Critiques (of pure rea-
son,practicalreason,andofthepowerofjudgment),Kanthadeffectively
undercut all prior metaphysics and managed to transform completely the
theoryofknowledge,philosophyofscience,moralphilosophy,thetheory
of agency in general, political thought, aesthetics, and even the philoso-
phy of biology. Moreover, it did not by any means go unnoticed that the
revolution in philosophy brought on by Kant’s insistence on freedom as
the linchpin of his system and the new revolution in politics and social
institutions in France might be more than casually linked. At one point,
WilhelmvonHumboldtwasaskedbysomeoftheleadingrevolutionaries
to give some talks explaining Kant, and Kant’s writings began appearing
in French. Even Napoleon got into the act. (He did not like Kant, not at
all.)3 In particular, Kant had seemed to many to resolve many of the cul-
turally unsettling debates of the day. Kant had held that all we can know
ofnatureisineffectwhatphysicsandtheothernaturalsciencescanteach
us, but that this kind of knowledge was restricted to the world as we had
to experience it, and we could not without pain of contradiction extend
that to the world as it might exist independently of the subjective con-
ditions of human experience. In practical matters, on the other hand, we
hadtoassumethatwewereinpossessionofakindofradicalfreedom.In
effect,Kanthadprovided,somanythought,aframeworkforendorsingall

Along with the French Revolution and the Kantian revolution in phi-
losophy,therewasalsotherevolutioninthenatureoftheuniversitygoing

is a long story, but in the 1790s, Jena, under the far-sighted leadership of
Goethe, was in the process of changing all of that. The university at Jena

any revelation given from the outside but only on the free, critical use of

andnotthetheological(orthemedicalorlaw)facultiesthathadtoprovide
thecoreandtheunityofthenewemerginguniversitybasedontherejec-
tionoforthodoxyandontheunityofteachingandresearch.(The“philo-
sophical”facultyinthisperiodwasnotsimplyidenticalwithwhatwould
now be called in American universities the “philosophy department.” It
also included what are now called the natural sciences along with other
“humanities” departments. This distinction among sciences, humanities,
and the like came later on in the development of the modern university.
IntermsoftheAmericanuniversity,the“philosophical”facultyeventually
became something like the “college of arts and sciences” that is virtually
universalnowamongAmericaninstitutionsofhigherlearning.)
Although it was widely felt that Kant had laid out the outline of the

unity. If the philosophical faculty was to be the guiding light of the new

all the other elements of the philosophical faculty, then it was considered
to be crucially important for the whole project of modern life that the
Kantiansystem–knownasthecriticalphilosophy,thetermKantusedto
describe it – be itself brought into order. The watchword became that of
following not the letter but the “spirit” of Kant, and at Jena there was a
succession of celebrated attempts to provide the requisite systematization
of Kantian philosophy, with each new attempt becoming bolder than the
earlier one.4 First, Karl Leonhard Reinhold became a professor at Jena in
1787andattractedhundredsofnewstudentstotheuniversitytohearhim
lecture on his own version of the Kantian program. When Reinhold left
Jena for a better-paying position at Kiel, he was succeeded in 1794 by the

further and took it into new territory. Fichte energized a new generation

However, not everyone in German intellectual circles was enthused by

close to importing the French Revolution into Germany. To many of the
samepeople,itamountednotmerelytotheloweringoftheimportanceof
the theological faculty but even to the rejection of the Christian religion
altogether. Leading figures of the time such as Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi
made public arguments to the effect that Kant’s philosophy, like all doc-

arguedthatallsuch“critical”philosophyultimatelyleadstoaformoffatal-
ism and atheism. His watchword for this result was “Spinoza,” both the
secret hero of many of the new thinkers and the bête noire of the anti-
Enlightenment crowd. Baruch Spinoza had famously claimed that there
wasonlyonesubstance,whichmeantthatGodcouldnotexist“outside”of
(thatis,wasnottranscendentto)theworld,andthismeantthattherecould
notbeapersonalGod.AllsuchEnlightenmentthinkers,soJacobiargued,
areultimatelypushedtosuchSpinozism,and,soJacobialsoclaimed,Kant
wasnoexception.
Inadditiontothestraightforwardsuspicionaboutthepotentiallyanti-
religious and “revolutionary” tendencies of the new movement, there was
also the new movement growing out of other people at Jena which called
itself “Romanticism.” Inspired by Fichte’s lectures and the way he was
working out the implications of Kant’s own stress on freedom – some
would say his “radicalization” of the Kantian program – they began to
articulateanalternativedirectionforpost-Kantianphilosophythatstressed
the need for a “fragmentary” and more aesthetic rather than systematic
approach to the same problems. In his third Critique, Kant himself had
noted,almostinpassing,thattheexperienceofthebeautifulgivesusasense
of what the underlying unity of nature and freedom might be, of some-
thingthatwouldbeitselfneither“nature”nor“freedom.”TheRomantics
of Jena took that seriously and tried to show that it was through diverse
actsofimagination,especiallythoseinvolvedinartofallsorts,thatweget
at what the “whole” of reality is really like, and not through the further
systematization of Kantian philosophy, as Reinhold and Fichte had tried
to do. In particular, they objected to what they saw as the overly abstract
nature of systematic philosophy and to its pretensions to encompass all
thatultimatelymatteredinlife.Weorientourselvesintheworldthrough

It was against this background that Hegel began composing his Phe-

Hegel contracted with a publisher in Bamberg to bring the book out,
and the publisher promised to pay Hegel for the manuscript only when
the book was half finished. As both Hegel and his publisher discovered,

Strangely enough, ever since the publication of the book itself the com-

In light of the diversity of the various interpretations, it worthwhile at
least to keep the words of the titles in mind. Hegel claims over and over
againthathisbookisa“Wissenschaft,”a“science,”somethingwhichraises
specialissuesforcontemporaryreadersthatwerenotthereinHegel’sown
time.Incallingforphilosophytobea“science,”itmightseemasifHegel
is proposing to make philosophy into something like physics or biology,
butnothinglikethatisthecase.Theuseoftheterm,Wissenschaft,encom-
passes more than what we currently mean by “science.” In the usage of
Hegel’s time, it means something like the systematic, rigorous pursuit of
knowledge.Forexample,duringthesameperiod,theologywasalsoturn-
ing itself into a Wissenschaft, a “science,” but, to put it anachronistically,
nobody at that time thought that it meant that theologians were eager to
don lab coats and fire up their propane burners. (It is also easy to for-
get that such relatively loose talk of “science” was once more common in
English.Intheearlyestablishmentoflawschoolsaspartsoftheuniversity

Mostclearly,thebookisa“phenomenology”ofsomethingcalled“Geist”
(which introduces yet another ambiguity, since in English Geist can be
equallywellandequallybadlyrenderedaseither“mind”or“spirit”).The
term “phenomenology” was in various uses at the time, but since it was
beingusedinavarietyofwaysbydifferentpeople,thereis(ofcourse)adis-
puteaboutwhatexactlythe“phenomenology”inthetitlerefersto.Thereis
adisputeaboutfromwhereandwhyHegeladoptedtheterm.Oneobvious

MetaphysicalFoundationsofNaturalScience(abookwithwhichHegelwas
deeplyfamiliar),hadspokenof“phenomenology”asapartofphysicscon-
cerned with the science of “true motion” as opposed to only “apparent
motion,” and thus as having to do not with “the transformation of mere
appearance(Schein)intotruth,butofappearance(Erscheinung)intoexpe-
rience (Erfahrung),” that is, into something from which we could learn.7
Inlightofthat,oneofHegel’salternativetitlesofthebook,“Scienceofthe
Experience (Erfahrung) of Consciousness,” is perhaps indicative of what

thephilosophyofGeist.
Consciousness
Hegel actually begins the “Science of the Experience of Consciousness”
with the conceit that he is beginning the discussion with something
relatively banal, absolutely certain, and obviously true, and thus under
the heading of “Consciousness” he begins with a section called simply,
“Sensuous-Certainty.”Attheveryleast,itstraightforwardlyclaims,wecan
be absolutely certain that we are aware of worldly items right here, right
now, and when we are thus aware of some singular something-or-other
right here, right now, our awareness is itself self-contained, such that it
warrantsmeinconfidentlyassertingthatIknowthis:Iamcertainofthis,
and I express this certainty not by simply reporting on it as an inner psy-
chological state but instead by just simply being certain and by holding
myselftothatcertainty.IthusknowthatIamimmediatelyawareofsim-
ple,singularitems.However,asIreflectonwhatitisIamdoingintermsof
howIactuallystatethatcertainty,varioustensionsandcontradictionsarise.
Astheargumentdevelops,itturnsoutthatifitisreallytobeknowledge,
then it will have to be knowledge of something ineffable. Unfortunately,
nothing ineffable can serve as a premise in any kind of inference, so if it
reallyisknowledgeIhave,itisnotknowledgethatisgoinganywhereelse.
As Hegel develops the chapter, the contradictions involved in my saying
that I am directly aware and truly certain of this, here, now begin to pile
up. But if it is true that my certainty, when it expresses itself, is fully self-
contradictory,thenIcannotreallybesaidtoknowthis,here,now,atall,or
notatleastinthewayIthoughtIhadknownit.Ifthatisthecase,whatwas

doing.Thecertaintyofbeingawareofthis,here,now,doesnotgoawayas
muchasitbecomesuntenable:Iamcertainofthis,butIamnot(cannot

Thereaderbreathesasighofrelief:Certaintyandtruthseemtomergeback

That unity of certainty and truth, however, does not last. In making
perceptualclaims,itturnsout(soHegelargues)thatwhatIamreallydoing
is perceiving things in a wider context – I am driven to that when once

matters such as non-perceptual forces that explain why this has suddenly

However, once the concept of infinity has been introduced, it is very
clear that we are no longer even remotely in the same area in which we
started. Infinity, or what Kant called the “unconditioned,” brings with it
an emerging set of new contradictions. The infinite is always full, but it

conceived. In thinking this perplexing thought, consciousness finds itself
pushedtoaconsciousnessofwhatitisreallydoing.Itnolongersimplyhas
its purposes before itself but now has purposes as purposes; it no longer
merely responds to truths but responds to them as truths; it no longer
responds to reasons but to reasons as reasons. In doing so, consciousness
becomes consciousness of consciousness, that is, self-consciousness. That
self-consciousnesshasturnedouttobewhatwewerereallydoingallalong.
At first, though, we did not know that, and, so it seems, it was just that
blindspotthatlandedusinsuchtroubleinthefirstthreesectionsof“Con-
sciousness.” If we had never started thinking about what we were really
doing,wemighthavethoughtweweremakingsense.However,itturned
out that we were not making sense, and as we reflected on it further, we
foundtheboundsofourconsciousnesspushedfurtherthanwehadorigi-
nallyanticipated.
Self-Consciousness
Hegel follows his chapter on “Consciousness” with a new chapter under
theheading“Self-Consciousness,”andbeginsitwithasectiontitled,“The
Truth of Self-Certainty.” What we are certain about, so it seems, is not
the individual things of the perceptual world but ourselves and especially
ourselvesasinhabitinganaturalstatus.Inthatcontext,wearecertainthat
we are experiencing a natural world in which we live, and that we know
we are alive. How do we know this? It is not, so it seems, through any
observationorinferencefromdatabutsimplybytheactivityoflivingitself.
Living things have something like this concept of infinity built into their
lives since they seem to be both the cause and effect of themselves. What
an animal does, it does because of its nature, which is determined by its
species. However, the particular animal is what it is by virtue of what it
does. Life itself seems to have this “chicken/egg” feature. We explain the
particular organs by reference to the animal itself (and by reference to its
species), but the animal is itself constituted and explained by its organs.
Life has a kind of purposiveness to it that has no obvious reference to a
designer,butitisonlyinself-consciouslifethatthiswholeoflifebecomes

In being certain of myself as myself, I am doing something, and it is
by doing this that I really am certain of my being alive. However, this

for a self-consciousness, so Hegel says. I am conscious of myself only in a
kind of second-person form, that of my consciousness of being known
by another embodied consciousness and by my awareness of that other’s
knowing me while knowing that I am aware of their knowing me. Right
at the outset, self-consciousness is already a two-in-one. The truth of my

Hegel follows up on the decisive conceptual failure of the relations of
pure domination with some short sections on stoicism and skepticism,

presented as philosophies that grabbed the attentionof the ancient world
as the great slave societies of antiquity (Greece and in particular Rome)
dominated the world of their day. This has puzzled many commentators

Introduction xxv
they are really radically different, then the ground will fail to connect to
the grounded in the right way. These are all problems with a view of rea-
son that sees itself as somehow merely regularizing appearances (as found
in empirical observation), and inevitably, this idea of “observing reason”
runs into its own set of contradictions. Even worse, in those areas where
“observingreason”doesbest,namely,themodesofexplanationthatwork
relatively well in physics, they all run into treacherously deep conceptual
difficulties when it comes to biology. Hegel discusses a number of spuri-
ousattemptsinhisowndaytodiscoverlawsoforganicdevelopmentthat
would mirror the law-likeness of physics. All fail, undone by their own
self-contradictionsandfacileabstractness.
The idea that one might do the same thing in the human sciences is
theneffectivelylampoonedbyHegelinhismock-seriousdiscussionofthe
“sciences” of physiognomy and phrenology. (It is not that Hegel thought
therewerenohumansciences.Hethought,forexample,thatAdamSmith’s
economicsofferedagoodmodelfordevelopinglawsofeconomicexchange
andgrowth.Hegelthoughtthattheattempttounderstandhumanhistory
and social life in the terms in which we correlate independent things was
metaphysicallylimited.)
The chapter on “Reason” suddenly and rather surprisingly switches
gears, and Hegel provides an account of how rational self-consciousness
actualizes itself. It is one thing to disparage the ways in which pseudo-
sciences like phrenology try to explain human life, but it is another to
construct an adequate account. Hegel’s own developmental account of
Geist thus resurfaces in the section on reason. Human action is not to be
explained,as“observingreason”wouldhaveit,asifitwereamatteroftwo

TheDisputedTurnfromReasontoGeist
At this point, so it seems, Hegel thought he had concluded the book.
Thereisgoodevidencetobelievethathavingfinishedthischapter,hethen
Introduction xxvii

“A: Consciousness” and “B: Self-Consciousness” chapters. (If that is true,
then “Reason” would have been a sub-chapter of “Self-Consciousness.”)
Hegelsentthecompletedmanuscriptofftotheprinter.11Itwasalsoatthis
pointthatHegelenteredintohisdisputewiththeprinter,apparentlytelling
himthatthebookwasnotinfactcomplete,andintheargumentbackand
forth Hegel almost scuttled the entire contract to publish the book at all.
The printer was in fact so angry with Hegel’s prevarications that Hegel’s
friend Immanuel Niethammer had to promise to pick up all the costs of
the print run if Hegel defaulted on producing what he now claimed was
the missing chapter or chapters of the whole book. What prompted this?
Eckart Förster has convincingly argued that after having been introduced
toGoethe’sMetamorphosisofPlantsbyafriendwhilehewasteachingthe
historyofphilosophy,Hegelcametooneofhisdefininginsights;namely,
first, that the history of philosophy could be understood as a developing
set of shapes of the same thing instead of just a procession of competing
philosophicalsystems,and,second,thatthisinsightcouldbeextendedto
allofhumanhistoryitself.Withthatinhand,Hegelsawthefailuresofthe
shapesexhibitedinthe“scienceoftheexperienceofconsciousness”showed
that the supposed essence hidden behind appearance was in fact not hid-
den at all but was actually itself working its own way out in history as it
shape-shifted itself in time. The form of self-conscious life was reshaping
itself in time, in a way very, very roughly analogous to the way in which
thedevelopmentofplantswasunderstoodinGoethe’ssystem.
Thus,intheoriginalscheme,thesectionontheactualizationofrational
self-consciousness through itself was supposed to culminate in “Science,”
which was to provide the immediate transition into a book on logic and
metaphysics.Inthenewscheme,Hegelrealizedhehadtoaddanentirely
new section to the chapter on “Reason,” so that the transition to Geist
wouldbeappropriate.Thenewsectionwascalled,“Individuality,Which,
toItself,isRealinandforItself.”Init,Hegelspokeoftheculminationofa
kindofindividualism,whichhecalledthe“spiritualkingdomofanimals”
(“geistigeTierreich”),andthemeaningofthechapteranditstitlehavebeen
debatedeversince.
The overall contours of the chapter develop out of Hegel’s critique of
treatinghumanactivityfromthestandpointof“observingreason,”which
isledbyitsownlogictoviewsuchactivityfromthe“outside,”fromathird-
personviewpoint,insteadoftakingthepurposivenessoflifeandespecially
ofhumanself-consciousnessintoaccount.Inthischapter,Hegeldrawsout

ops out of this “observing reason” approach. Such an approach acknowl-

on men is essential. Put into practice, this leads to a monological view of
purposiveness itself, and we imagine what a society based on such sub-
jects each viewing themselves completely monologically would look like.
The kind of second-person recognition which was essential to the chap-
teron“self-consciousness”istherebyfortheseactorssidelined,movedinto
being regarded “merely” as a natural biological feature of self-conscious
life, or simply submerged from our notice. Thus, in the world that sees
itselffullymonologically,everybodyclaimstobeworkingonlyoutoftheir
ownsingularinterestconcerningwhatreallymatters(“dieSacheselbst”)and
to be essentially unconcerned with what others think. Thus, it presents a
semi-comical scene in which everybody keeps busily making loud pub-
lic pronouncements, all while claiming that the public’s reaction to their
pronouncements is fully irrelevant. Hegel speaks of this as a kind of dual
self-deception and a deception of others. Such a view of course collapses
underitsownweight–thatofaffirmingtheessentialityoftheotherwhile
insistentlydenyingtheessentialityoftheother–anddisclosesthatinfact
what really matters, the real thing at stake, is Geist itself as “the doing of
each and all, the essence that is the essence of all essence, that is spiritual
essence.” He followsthatwithtwohighlycompressed sections whosepur-

concept of spirit as concepts are the statements of the ways in which that
wayoflifecanflourish(or,inHegel’supdatedversionofAristotle’sconcep-
tion of Eudaimonia, “be satisfied”). Judgments about spirit are thus both

puted, and his portrait of Antigone has been the object of much feminist
interpretation. For Hegel, Antigone is the foreshadowing of the kind of
self-consciousindividualitythattheGreekworldcreatedandwhichundid

just a few, overly condensed paragraphs in the Phenomenology. The result
of the Greek denouement and the Roman takeover followed by its own
spectacular downfall is the topic of a new section, “Spirit Alienated from
Itself,” in which Hegel argues that in light of the Greek and Roman fail-
ure,Europeanlifetookitsconcepttobemorenarrowthanithadin“true
spirit.” It comes to think that the essence of self-consciousness is not to
find itself essentially in any particular social order at all but to be only an
individual point of view on the world that has to accommodate itself to
theexternalfactsoflife.Itcannoteverfullyinhabitthatlife,andsoliving
a self-conscious life becomes a matter for it of standing back and judging
whether it can reflectively identify with its given world since spirit alien-

ceptofself-consciouslifeassimplyapointofviewontheworlddoesnot
imply any determinate conduct or virtue. Whatever standards there are

Iftheworldof“truespirit”wasdyadic–embodyingthewaysinwhich
friendship and justice expressed the essentially relational structure of self-
conscious lives in a community with each other – that of self-alienated
spirit was essentially monadic, expressing the mediated relation of self to
others via something like a system of rules. In the world of self-alienated
spirit,justicebecomesamatterofsocialrulesandnotthevirtueofjustice

In a series of different historically arranged sections, Hegel traces out
the way in which self-alienated spirit is compelled to empty itself further.

European Enlightenment, where the alienated self comes to believe that

of the world all the way to its core, and trusts that it and it alone can
drilldeeplyintotherealessencebehindtheappearingworld.TheEnlight-

that formed its contemporaries and its enemies, who thought that armed

couldpeerintothetrueanddivineessenceoftheappearingworld.Evenif
the Enlightenment always ends up winning the argument (which is to be

still playing by something like the same rules: monologically conceived,

sees itself as really only a point of view on the world and sees the facts
of the world as putting no real normative constraints on itself. It thereby
comes to think that self-conscious life alone determines the rules of the

withKant’sequalinsistencethatwecouldalsonotbeexpectedtorenounce

knotsthat“morality”onitsownseemedunabletountie.Inparticular,so
Hegel rather contentiously argued, it led to a kind of moralistic dissem-

of extraneous matters to make the otherwise self-contradictory moralistic

Inhisstagingofthebreakdownofthe“beautifulsoul”asawayofliving,
Hegel imagines a confrontation between two beautiful souls, with each

says,andsuchastanceeitherconsumesitselfinitsownself-absorption,or
eventually its own isolated life is too much to bear, its hard heart breaks,
and the two reconcile. With that, the purely monological, monadic form
collapses,andtheI/Youdyadicformisrecaptured.Intriguingly,Hegelthen
asserts that in such a two-in-one of forgiveness and reconciliation, God
actuallyappearsintheirmidst.
Religion
ThatlaunchesHegelintothepenultimatechapter,titled“Religion.”When
Hegel first began thinking about a possible system of philosophy, he
thought that religion would in fact have to be the end-point since the
finaleofsuchasystemisafullcomprehensionofinfinityitself,andathis
early stage of philosophical development, he thought that infinity simply
escaped all attempts at conceptualizing it and had to be left to a kind of
religiousintuition,apositionhewasnevercomfortabletoinhabit.Herad-
icallychangedhismindbythetimehegottowritingthePhenomenology,
where he came to the notorious and difficult to interpret Hegelian claim
that ultimately the claims of conceptual thought trump the more repre-
sentationalistimaginingsofreligion.Religioncanonlygosofarandmust

Hegel takes religion to be one of the most basic ways in which self-

Translator’s Note
AlthoughHegel’sPhenomenologyofSpiritisundoubtedlyacanonicalwork
anddeservesthehighreputationinthehistoryofphilosophywhichithas
always had, even Hegel’s staunchest admirers have to admit that it is not,
at least on a first reading, a clearly written book. Indeed, even those who
defendwhatonephilosopherhascalledits“ferociousidiom,”surelymust
acknowledge that whatever other virtues that idiom possesses, its initial
density is almost unrivaled.13 In translating such a densely written book,
thetranslator(especiallyifheisotherwisefavorablydisposedtothebook’s
contents) is thus always under the temptation to make the author more
easy-going in the translation than he was in the original. However, in the
caseofthePhenomenology,givingintothetemptationtomakeHegel’stext
moreeasy-goinginevitablymeansthatmoreofthetranslator’sinterpreta-
tionofthetextwillbeintroducedthanisotherwisedesirable.Tobesure,
all translations are interpretations of a sort, but that is still no excuse to
transform the normal amount of interpretive give and take into a license
ofsortstomakethebookmeanwhatthetranslatorwishesitmeant.Like
many of Hegel’s other translators, I too have often been tempted to take
Hegelbythehandandtellhimthat,no,thisisthewayheshouldhavesaid

Forexample,thereisHegel’susageof“ansich”and“fürsich”(“initself”
and“foritself”).Theterm,“ansich,”isofcoursebestknowntoanglophone
philosophers in Kant’s use of it in the term, “Ding an sich,” the “thing in
itself.”
“Für sich,” on the other hand, has an ordinary German usage where it
often means something like “on its own” or “apart from,” or even “on its
ownaccount.”Jean-PaulSartrealsofamouslypickeduptheHegelianterms

saidtobeverygenerally“Hegelian,”healsogavethoseHegeliantermsalife

not be confused with Hegel’s own use of those terms. Hegel usually uses

especially the kind that human agents have to themselves; but sometimes

canexperienceit).Ifonetookthatroute,thenthedistinctionbetween“für

Yet another more vernacular meaning of “an sich” would be the term “as

Keeping Hegel’s terminology visible also means that I have to be rel-

althoughbothcouldbeequallywellrenderedas“initself.”Todoso,Ihave
oftentranslated“insich”as“withinitself.”However,sinceneitherthatdis-

Likewise, in many cases, I have chosen to translate Hegel’s deliberately
odd German into deliberately odd English in order to preserve the sense

but since Hegel sometimes uses both “an sich” and “an ihm selbst” in the

xl Translator’sNote
works, the German term carries two senses in different contexts, namely,
“tocancel”(asincancelingone’sinsurancepolicy)andtosaveorpreserve
(asin“saveaplaceforme”).HegeltellshisGermanreadersthatheintends
to use the word in both senses, although in the context in which he usu-
ally employs the term, he most often clearly means “cancel” or “negate,”
whereasinothercasesheclearlymeanssomethingmorelike“preserve.”
Torender“aufheben”intoEnglish,Hegel’stranslatorsinthenineteenth
century opted to revive an older term in English, “sublate,” which for all
practicalpurposeshaddiedoutofEnglishusagebythemiddleofthenine-
teenthcentury.StartingitssemanticlifeinEnglish(havingbeenimported
from the Latin) in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it meant “to
remove” or “to take away,” and it came to be used in discussions of logic,
such that even an authority like Sir William Hamilton used it in the
mid-nineteenth century in his writings on logic and knowledge to mean
“negate.”WhenHegel’sfirsttranslatorsadoptedtheoldertermtotranslate
Hegel’s use of “aufheben,” they simply stipulated that it was intended to
carry both of its German meanings. Although many have suspected that

and he uses it in a way that is supposed to bring to mind what is usually
rendered in English as “actuality” when translating Aristotle or Aquinas.

Ratherthanuse“objectify,”“externalize,”“realize,”or“alienate”(threepop-

evocative,“relinquishing.”InmoreordinaryGerman,Entäußerungmeans
“to renounce,” “to divest,” or “to give up.” One reason for doing this is
so that the other uses of “renounce” in the text (where it translates, for
example,“verzichten”)arekeptseparatefromtheoccurrencesofthemore

asclearaspossiblewherethetermoccurs,whatitsbackgroundassociations
are,andtoletthereadersdecideforthemselves.
Hegel’s use of the ordinary German term, “Sittlichkeit,” which could
easily be rendered as “morals” or “morality” (as Kant’s translators usually
render Kant’s use of the same term) presents another conundrum. If one
rendersit“morality,”thenonehasnowayofmakingtheHegeliandistinc-
tion between Sittlichkeit and Moralität (morality). In other places, Hegel
explicitlysaysthatSittlichkeitandMoralitätbasicallymeanthesamething
in ordinary German, but he is insisting on using them in different senses
to mark what for him is a crucial conceptual distinction. The term, “Sit-
tlichkeit,”drawsheavilyontheterm,“Sitte,”whichcanberenderedasthe
“mores” of a time, and that might suggest that one adopt a new usage in
English, “moresness.” The inadvisability of that choice speaks for itself.
Instead,Ihavechosenthenowestablishedtermofart,“ethicallife,”which
hasbeenusedbyothertranslatorsofHegelasarenderingof“Sittlichkeit.”
There is another issue all too familiar to interpreters of Hegel: How to
translate “Vorstellung”? The term colloquially means “idea,” and in some
contextsitevenmeanssomethinglike“imagine.”Itmakesitsappearance
in German Idealism in Kant’s use of it, where Norman Kemp Smith ren-
dereditinhistranslationofthefirstCritiqueas“representation”(following
Kant’s own Latin rendition of it as “repraesentatio”). However, whereas in
the first Critique Kant claimed that there were two types of “representa-
tions,” namely, intuitions and concepts, Hegel typically contrasts “repre-
sentation”(Vorstellung)with“concept”(Begriff).Moreover,inhispractical
philosophy,whenKanttalksaboutfreedomconsistingofactingintermsof
ourconception(oridea)oflaw,hetypicallyuses“Vorstellung”fortheword
thatEnglishreadersarefamiliarwithinthatcontextas“idea”or“concep-
tion.” I have tended to render it as “representation” and in many cases as
“representationalthought”whereIthinkHegelistryingtocontrast“repre-
sentationalthinking”with“conceptualthinking.”Ialsothinkthatitmakes
Hegel’stextflowmoreeasily(although“flowingeasily”isclearlyarelative
termwhenappliedtoanypartofthePhenomenology).Inaveryfewplaces
Ihaverendereditas“imagine,”butsinceIthinkthatthismightbeamat-
ter of possible dispute, I have always indicated where I have done that in
afootnote.Likewise,Ihaveonthewholerendered“Anschauung”as“intu-
ition” to keep the similarities and differences between Hegel’s use of this
wordand,toanglophonereaders,Kant’suseoftheword(whereKantuses
ittodistinguishthattypeof“representation”fromthatof“concepts”).
To keep the relation to the Kantian vocabulary, I have also translated
“derVerstand”as“theunderstanding,”theclassictranslationofwhatKant
xliv Translator’sNote
regardedasoneofthebasicfacultiesofthemind.Inmanyways,“intellect”
(ormaybeeven“ordinaryunderstanding”)wouldbeabetterrenderingof
this phrase, and I have occasionally used that and indicated in a footnote
thatittranslates“Verstand.”
A related problem has to do with Hegel’s use of “Bewußtsein”
(“consciousness”). Much hinges on the distinctions he makes between
“consciousness,” “self-consciousness,” and “spirit.” But when he uses very
ordinary German terms such as “zum Bewußtsein kommen”, or “mit
Bewußtsein,” which would ordinarily simply be translated as “aware of”
or “consciously”, he is often trying to make a point about what is going
on in light of those distinctions. I have therefore often translated those
phrases more literally than they would otherwise be rendered as “coming
toconsciousness”and“withconsciousness.”Thatmakesthetextabitmore
awkwardthanitwouldotherwisebe,butitatleastletsthereadernotethose
typesofoccurrences.
There is also the problem of “In-sich-gehen” and “In-sich-sein”: Hegel
makes frequent use of these terms near the end of the book. I have ren-
dered “in-sich-gehen” as “taking-the-inward-turn” instead of the more lit-
eral and wooden “going-into-oneself” or “going-into-the-self.” However,
even if one likes that as a solution, it raises another problem: What to do
with“In-sich-sein”?Tokeepthelinkbetweenthetwo,Ihaverendereditas
“inwardly-turned-being.” I realize that this sounds a bit odd, but then so
does“In-sich-sein.”Italsomakesmoreperspicuousthedistinctionbetween
“ansich”and“insich”asthatbetween“initself”and“withinitself.”
Likewise, one of Hegel’s key terms is that of consciousness or self-
consciousness being “bei sich.” The term carries lots of different conno-
tations,butIhaverendereditas“beingatonewithoneself.”Thetermis
crucialsinceinotherworks,Hegelgoessofarastoclaimthatfreedomitself
consistsinbeing“beisichinanother.”Ihaveusuallyindicateditspresence
inafootnote.
There is also the matter of translating “die Sache selbst.” Every writer
on Hegel in English has his or her own idea about how to render this,
and they all disagree, sometimes vehemently, with each other. There sim-
ply is no single English word, nor, for that matter, a single phrase which
adequately translates the German term with all the nuances that Hegel
playswith(especiallyinthechapter,“TheSpiritualKingdomofAnimals”).
Someoftherenderingsrunfrom“thethingthatmatters,”“thepointofit
all,”“theheartofthematter,”“thecruxofthematter,”tosimply“whatis
at stake,” “the Thing itself.” It could probably be rendered slightly more
accurately as “the nitty-gritty”, but that is not perfect and it is far too

thedistinctionandconnectionbetweentwoGermanterms,a“Sache”(as
a “thing”) and a “Ding ”(as a more “thingy” thing). For all that matter,
perhaps “thing” in the sense of hipster sixties lingo (as in, “Do your own

ofHegelsaidthattheterm,“Sache,”meansbothathingoutsideofoneself
and“thesubstantialessence.”15SincethereisnosimpleEnglishtranslation
oftheterm,“Sacheselbst,”the“cruxofthematter”willhavetodo.
In the case of a few words that no longer appear in most contempo-
rary German dictionaries (such as “Selbstwesen”), I consulted the older
nineteenth-century Grimms’ Deutsches Wörterbuch for a meaning. I have
notedthoseoccurrencesinthefootnotes.
Ihavedecidedtokeeptheindependentparagraphnumberingthatwas
introducedbyA.V.Millerinhistranslation.Thereisnosuchnumbering
system (or anything like it) in the original German text, but the system
has proven itself to be useful for marking the place in the text for class
discussions and for reference, and thus I have retained it. Unfortunately,
MilleraddedandsubtractedparagraphsinhisEnglishversionthatwerenot
thereintheGermanedition,somynumberingscheme,whichfollowsthe
paragraph markings of the critical edition in German, is slightly different
fromtheolderMillertranslation.
The pagination in margins refers to the text of the Gesammelte Werke

PhänomenologiedesGeistesandcheckeditagainstthecriticaleditionpub-
lished by Felix Meiner Verlag in 1999 as volume two in their six-volume
critical edition of Hegel’s works. That is page-for-page identical with the
critical edition edited by Wolfgang Bonsiepen and Reinhard Heede in
Hegel’s Gesammelte Werke, also published by Felix Meiner. I also con-

2.Determiningtherelationthataphilosophicalworkprofessestobear
vis-à-vis other efforts at dealing with the same object also introduces an
extraneous interest, and it thereby only renders obscure what is supposed
to be at stake in taking cognizance3 of the truth. The more that conven-
tional opinion holds that the opposition between the true and the false
is itself fixed and set, the more that it customarily expects to find itself
in either agreement or in contradiction with any given philosophical sys-
tem, and, if so, then in any explanation of such a system, the more it
will only see the one or the other. It does not comprehend the diversity
ofphilosophicalsystemsastheprogressivedevelopmentoftruthasmuch
asitseesonlycontradictioninthatdiversity.Thebuddisappearswhenthe
blossom breaks through, and one might say that the former is refuted by
the latter. Likewise, through the fruit, the blossom itself may be declared
to be a false existence of the plant, since the fruit emerges as the blos-

little more than a contrivance for avoiding what is really at stake, or as
anattempttocombinethesemblanceofbothseriousnessandeffortwhile

the subject matter is not exhausted in its aims; rather, it is exhaustively
treatedwhenitisworkedout.Noristheresultwhichisreachedtheactual
wholeitself;rather,thewholeistheresulttogetherwiththewaytheresult
comes to be. The aim for itself is the lifeless universal in the way that the 11
tendency of the work itself is a mere drive that still lacks actuality; the
unadorned result is just the corpse that has left the tendency behind. –

wherethethingwhichisatstakeceases,oritiswhatthatthingisnot.To

6 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
philosophy nearer to the form of science – to bring it nearer to the goal
whereitcan layaside thetitleofloveof knowingandbeactualknowing–
is the task I have set for myself. The inner necessity that knowing should
be science lies in the nature of knowing, and the satisfactory explanation
for this inner necessity is solely the exposition of philosophy itself. How-
ever,externalnecessity,insofarasthisisgraspedinauniversalmannerand
insofaraspersonalcontingenciesandindividualmotivationsaresetaside,
is the same as the internal necessity which takes on the shape in which
timepresents8 theexistenceofitsmoments.Todemonstratethatitisnow

12 true justification of any attempt that has this as its aim, because it would
demonstrate the necessity of that aim, and, at the same time, it would be
therealizationoftheaimitself.
6. In positing that the true shape of truth lies in its scientific rigor –
or, what is the same thing, in asserting that truth has the element of its
existence solely in concepts – I do know that this seems to contradict an
idea9(alongwithallthatfollowsfromit),whosepretentiousnessismatched
onlybyitspervasivenessintheconvictionsofthepresentage.Itthusdoes
not seem completely gratuitous to offer an explanation of this contradic-
tion even though at this stage such an explanation can amount to little
more than the same kind of dogmatic assurance which it opposes. How-
evermuch,thatistosay,thetrueexistsonlyinwhat,orratherexistsonly
as what, is at one time called intuition and at another time called either
the immediate knowing of the absolute, or religion, or being – notat the
center of the divine love, but the being of divine love itself – still, if that
is taken as the point of departure, what is at the same time demanded in
the exposition of philosophy is going to be instead the very opposite of
theformoftheconcept.Theabsoluteisnotsupposedtobeconceptually

not so much to bring chaotic consciousness back both to a well-thought- 13

thought has torn asunder and then to stir it all together into a smooth
mélange, to suppress the concept that makes those distinctions, and then
to fabricate the feeling of the essence. What it wants from philosophy is

keepupitsguardagainstthedesiretobeedifying.
10. Even to a lesser extent must this kind of science-renouncing self-
satisfaction claim that such enthusiasm and obscurantism is itself a bit
higher than science. This prophetic prattle imagines that it resides at the
center of things, indeed that it is profundity itself, and, viewing determi-
nateness(thehoros)withcontempt,itintentionallystandsalooffromboth
theconceptandfromnecessity,whichitholdstobeatypeofreflectionat
homeinmerefinitude.However,inthewaythatthereisanemptybreadth,
there is also an empty depth, just as likewise there is an extension of sub-
stance which spills over into finite diversity without having the power to
keep that diversity together – this is an intensity without content, which,
althoughitmakesoutasifitwereasheerforcewithoutdispersion,isinfact
no more than superficiality itself. The force of spirit is only as great as its
expression,anditsdepthgoesonlyasdeepasittrustsitselftodisperseitself
andtoloseitselfinitsexplicationofitself.–Atthesametime,ifthissub-
stantial knowing, itself so totally devoid of the concept, pretends to have
immersed the very ownness of the self in the essence and to philosophize
inallholinessandtruth,thenwhatitisreallydoingisjustconcealingfrom
itself the fact that instead of devoting itself to God, it has, by spurning
all moderation and determinateness, instead simply given itself free rein
withinitselftothecontingencyofthatcontentandthen,withinthatcon-
tent, given free rein to its own arbitrariness. – While abandoning them-
selves to the unbounded fermentation of the substance, the proponents
of that view suppose that, by throwing a blanket over self-consciousness
and by surrendering all understanding, they are God’s very own, that they
are those to whom Godimparts wisdom in their sleep. What they in fact
receive and what they give birth to in their sleep are, for that reason also
onlydreams.

Without this development, science has no general intelligibility,13 and it
seems to be the esoteric possession of only a few individuals – an esoteric
possession, because at first science is only available in its concept, or in
what is internal to it, and it is the possession of a few individuals, since

16. In so doing, this formalism asserts that this monotony and abstract
universality is the absolute, and it assures us that any dissatisfaction with
such universality is only an incapacity to master the absolute standpoint
and keep a firm grip on it. However much there was once a time when
the empty possibility of imagining17 things differently was sufficient to
refute a view,18 and however much the general thought, the same mere
possibility, had also at that time the entirely positive value of actual cog-
nition, nonetheless nowadays we see the universal Idea19 in this form of

21.However,thisabhorrence22ofmediationstemsinfactfromalackof
acquaintance with the nature of mediation and with the nature of abso-
lute cognition itself. This is so because mediation is nothing but self-
moving self-equality, or, it is a reflective turn into itself, the moment of
the I existing-for-itself, pure negativity, or, simple coming-to-be. The I, or,
coming-to-be, this mediating, is, on account of its simplicity, immediacy
in the very process of coming-to-be and is the immediate itself. – Hence,

theresultanditscoming-to-be.Thisissobecausethiscoming-to-beisjust
as simple and hence not different from the form of the true, which itself
proves itself to be simple in its result. Coming-to-be is instead this very
return into simplicity. – However much the embryo is indeed in itself a

22.Whathasjustbeensaidcanalsobeexpressedbysayingthatreason
is purposive doing. Both the exaltation of a nature supposedly above and
beyond thinking, an exaltation which misconstrues thinking, and espe-
cially the banishment of external purposiveness have brought the form
of purpose completely into disrepute. Yet, in the sense in which Aristotle
also determines nature as purposive doing, purpose is the immediate, the
motionless,whichisself-moving,or,issubject.Itsabstractpowertomoveis
being-for-itself,or,purenegativity.Forthatreason,theresultisthesameas

24.Amongthemanyconsequencesthatfollowfromwhathasbeensaid,
this in particular can be underscored: It is only as a science or as a system

If the refutation is thorough, then it is derived from and developed out
of that fundamental proposition or principle itself – the refutation is not
pulledoffbybringingincounter-assertionsandimpressionsexternaltothe

25. That the true is only actual as a system, or, that substance is essen-
tially subject, is expressed in the representation that expresses the abso-
lute as spirit – the most sublime concept and the one which belongs to
modernity24 and its religion. The spiritual alone is the actual; it is the

27.Thiscoming-to-beofscienceitself,or,ofknowing,iswhatispresented 24
in this phenomenology of spirit as the first part of the system of science.
Knowing, as it is at first, or, as immediate spirit, is devoid of spirit, is sen-
suous consciousness. In order to become genuine knowing, or, in order to
beget the element of science which is its pure concept, immediate spirit
must laboriously travel down a long path. – As it is established in its

differently from the way a set of instructions on how to take unscientific
consciousness up to and into science would appear; it also appears some-

whose substance is spirit standing at the higher level runs through these
past forms in the way that a person who takes up a higher science goes
through those preparatory studies which he has long ago internalized in

In that kind of back-and-forth chatter about various pros and cons, such
knowing, without knowing how it happens to it, never really gets any-

purethoughtsbecomeconcepts,andareforthefirsttimewhattheyarein
truth: self-moving movements, circles, which are what their substance is;
namely,spiritualessentialities.
34. This movement of pure essentialities constitutes the nature of sci-
entific rigor per se. As the connectedness of its content, this movement is
both the necessity of that content and its growth into an organic whole.
The path along which the concept of knowing is reached likewise itself
becomes a necessary and complete coming-to-be, so that this preparation

35. Furthermore, such an account constitutes the first part of science,
since the existence of spirit as primary is nothing else but the immediate
itself, or, the beginning, which is not yet its return into itself. Hence, the
element of immediate existence is the determinateness though which this
part of science renders itself distinct from the other parts. – The account
ofthisdifferenceleadsdirectlytothediscussionofafewofthoseidéesfixes

36. The immediate existence of spirit, consciousness, has two moments,
namely,knowingandtheobjectivitywhichisnegativetoknowing.While
spirit develops itself in this element and explicates its moments therein,
still this opposition corresponds to these moments, and they all come on

can be viewed as thedefect of the two, but it is their very soul or is what

Spirit is an object to itself in the way that it is, and the abstract element
ofimmediacyandtheseparationbetweenknowingandtruthisovercome.
Being is absolutely mediated – it is a substantial content which is just as
much immediately the possession of the I, is self-like, or is the concept.
Withthat,thephenomenologyofspiritbringsitselftoitsconclusion.What
spirit prepares for itself in its phenomenology is the element of knowing.
In this element, the moments of spirit unfold themselves into the form of

time, over and against space as the second material for its study. Applied
mathematics,tobesure,dealswithtimeinthewayitdealswithmotionand
otheractualthings,butitincorporatessyntheticpropositions,i.e.,propo-
sitions about their ratios which are determined by their concept. It takes
those synthetic propositions from experience, and it only applies its for-

sitionswhichappliedmathematicsfrequentlyprovides,suchasthosecon-
cerningtheequilibriumofthelever,therelationofspaceandtimeinfalling

as oddas itwouldbeinstructive; inpart itwouldcleanse mathematics of
this kind of false polish, and in part it would point out both its limita-

thiscognizing,which,itselfbeinganexternalactivity,reduceswhatisself-
movingto“stuff”simplyinordernowtohaveinthat“stuff”anindifferent,
external,lifelesscontent.
47.Incontrast,philosophydoesnotstudyinessentialdeterminationsbut
only those that are essential. The abstract or the non-actual is not its ele-
ment and content; rather, its element and content is the actual, what is
self-positing, what is alive within itself, or existence in its concept. It is
the process which creates its own moments and passes through them all;
it is the whole movement that constitutes the positive and its truth. This

courtofthatmovement,theindividualshapesofspiritdonotstablyexist
any more than do determinate thoughts, but they are also equally posi-
tive, necessary moments just as much as they are negative, disappearing
moments. – In the whole of the movement, taken as being at rest, what
distinguishes itself in it and what gives itself existence is preserved as the
kindthatremembers,asthatwhoseexistenceisitsknowingofitself,justas

its concept lies in what has already been said, and its genuine exposition
belongs to logic, or is instead even logic itself, for the method is nothing

For that reason, such a method is peculiar to mathematics and must be

relationship of magnitude, and takes its material from dead space as well

that, more or less, a preface does. In everyday life, consciousness has for
its content little bits of knowledge, experiences, sensuous concretions, as
wellasthoughts,principles,and,ingeneral,ithasitscontentinwhatever
is present, or in what counts as a fixed, stable entity or essence. In part
consciousness continues on this path, and in part it interrupts the whole
context through a free, arbitrary choice about such content, in which it

60. But in view of the fact that such thinking has a content, whether
the content is that of representations, or of thoughts, or is a mixture of
the two, there is another aspect to it which makes such conceptual com-

heretothemultiplicityofdeterminations,orthepredicates.Itisherethat
the knowing I takes the place of that subject, and it is here that it is both
the binding together of the predicates and the subject supporting them.
However, while that former subject enters into the determinations them-
selves and is their soul, the second subject, which is to say, the knowing
subject,findsthattheformer,whichitwassupposedtobeoveranddone
with,andwhichitwantstogobeyondinordertoreturnintoitself,isstill
there in the predicate. Instead of being able to be what sets the predicate
in motion, the subject, as merely clever argumentation over whether this
or that predicate is supposed to be attached, has instead something to do
with the self of the content. The subject is not supposed to be for itself,

the complaints about the unintelligibility of philosophical literature even

for understanding such philosophical writing. In what is said about this,
we see the reason behind the specific reproach which is so often leveled
against such writings, namely, that so much has to be read over and over
againbeforeitcanbeunderstood–areproachwhichhastodowithsuch
definitiveunreasonablenessthat,ifitwerejustified,norejoinderwouldbe
possible.–Itisclearfromtheabovewhatisatstakehere.Thephilosoph-
ical proposition, because it is a proposition, evokes the common opinion
about both the usual relationship between subject and predicate and the
customary procedure of knowing. This procedure and common opinion
aboutsuchaproceduredestroysitsphilosophicalcontent.Commonopin-
ionthenlearnsfromexperiencethatitmeanssomethingotherthanwhat
it took itself to have meant, and this correction of its opinion compels
knowing to come back to the proposition and now to grasp it in some

kind of philosophical exposition which rigorously excludes the ordinary
relationsamongthepartsofapropositionwhichwouldbeabletoachieve
thegoalofplasticity.
65. In fact, non-speculative thinking also has its rights, which are valid
but which are ignored in the speculative proposition. The sublation of

sorts, the proof constitutes this aspect of expressed inwardness. However,

66. On this point, it is worth remembering that the dialectical move-
ment likewise has propositions for its parts or elements. Thus, the high-
lighted difficulty seems to recur continually and to be a difficulty in the
natureofthesubjectmatter.–Thisissimilartowhathappensinthecase

68. With a view to genuine philosophy, we see the following. In lieu
of the long course of cultural formation, a movement as rich as it is pro-
found and through which spirit arrives at knowing, we now see the view
thatboththeimmediaterevelationofthedivineandtheviewsofhealthy

how ignorance mixed with formless, tasteless crudity, which is itself inca-
pable of concentrating its thoughts on an abstract proposition and even
less so on the connections among many such propositions, assures itself
at one time that it is itself freedom and is tolerance of thinking, and at
another time it even assures itself of its own genius. Genius once was, as
everyone knows, all the rage in poetry, just as it is nowadays also the rage

71. While I have posited that science exists as a result of the self-
movement of the concept, and while my way of looking at all the aspects
ofthisdivergesfromcurrentideas55 aboutthenatureandshapeoftruth–
allof which are in fact quite opposed to my own views (and not only the
ones I have cited but others as well) – there does not seem to be much
promise at all that an attempt to expound the system of science accord-
ing to the characterization I have given of it will be received favorably.
In the meantime, I can bear in mind that, for example, the excellence of
Plato’s philosophy has sometimes been said to lie in his scientifically val-
uelessmyths,andtherehavealsobeentimes,whichhaveevenbeencalled
times of religious enthusiasm,56 in which the Aristotelian philosophy was

of our time is that it has posited that its very value lies in scientific rigor
itself. And even though others take a different view, it is only through its 49
scientific rigor that the philosophy of our time has in fact begun to make
itself felt. I can thereby also hope that this attempt to vindicate science’s
right to the concept and to expound science in this, its own distinctive
element,willknowhowtoforceitswaythroughthecrowdbywayofthe

also hold on to the conviction that the individual requires this effect in
ordertoconfirmforhimselfwhatisasyetforhimstillonlyhisownsoli-

them.Howevermuchthepublicwillgood-naturedlyputtheblameupon

resentatives, so convinced of their own authority in the matter, will put
all the blame instead on the authors. The work’s effect on the public is
more silent than the acts of these “dead burying their dead.”57 However

cultivated,andthepublic’scuriositymorewakeful,andhowevermuchits

by those imposing assurances and their dismissive acts of censure. After
a while, some are thus provided with a world of their own, whereas for
some others, after a certain period of time, there is simply no posterity
atall.
72. For the rest, at a time when the universality of spirit has grown so
much stronger, and, as is fitting, when what is purely singular has corre-
spondingly become even more a matter of indifference, and so too when
the universality of spirit now both sticks to its entire breadth and claims
all the cultural wealth it has built up, then the share in the total work of

or it will prove to be not real knowing. But while it immediately regards
itself rather as real knowing, this path has negative meaning for it, and
what is the realization of the concept will count instead, to it, as the loss
of itself, for on this path, it loses its truth. This path can accordingly be
regardedasthepathofdoubt,or,moreproperly,asthepathofdespair;on
this path, what happens is not what is customarily understood as doubt,
a shaking of this or that supposed truth, followed by the disappearance
again of the doubt, and then a return to the former truth so that in the

cultivation in the simple mode of a project as immediately finished and

of the project. To be sure, following one’s own conviction is more than
submittingoneselftoauthority;buttheconvertingofopinionswhichare

81.Justasthesepreliminaryandgeneralremarksaboutthemannerand
the necessity of the progression have been made, so too it might be use-
ful to recall something about the method of the way it is carried out. This
exposition, represented as the conduct of science in relation to knowing
as it appears,4 and represented as the investigation and testing of the real-
ity of cognition, seems incapable of taking place without some kind of

83. If we then investigate the truth of knowing, it seems that we are
investigating what knowing is in itself. Yet in this investigation, knowing
is our object. It is for us, and the in-itself of knowing, which would result
from the investigation, would be instead its being for us. What we would
assert to be its essence would instead not be its truth but rather only our 59
knowing of it. The essence or the standard would lie within us, and that
which was supposed to be compared with the standard, and that about
whichadecisionwassupposedtobemadeonthebasisofthiscomparison

comparison,thetwodonotcorrespondtooneanother,thenitseemsasif
consciousness must alter its knowing in order to make it adequate to the
object.However,inknowing’salteration,theobjectitselfis,toconscious-
ness, also in fact altered; for the knowing which is present was essentially
aknowingoftheobject;alongwiththeknowing,theobjectalsobecomes
something different, for it belonged essentially to this knowing. Thus to
consciousness it comes to be the case that what, to it, was previously the
in-itself, is not in itself, or that it was in itself only for consciousness. While
itthereforefindsonitsobject’spartthatitsknowingdoesnotcorrespond
to the object, the object itself also does not endure. That is, the standard
for the examination is altered when that for which it was supposed to be
the standard itself fails the examination, and the examination is not only
an examination of knowing but also an examination of the standard of
knowing.
86.Thisdialecticalmovementwhichconsciousnesspracticesinitsown
self (as well as in its knowing and in its object),insofar as, for conscious-
ness, the new, true object arises out of this movement, is properly what is
called experience. In this respect, there is in the process just mentioned a
moment to be highlighted more precisely, and this will cast a new light
onthescientificaspectsofthefollowingexposition.Consciousnessknows
something, and this object is the essence, or the in-itself; but the object is
alsoforconsciousnessthein-itself;andwiththisthedoublemeaningofthis
truthcomesonthescene.Weseethatconsciousnessnowhastwoobjects:
Oneisthefirstin-itself,andthesecondisthebeing-for-itofthisin-itself.The
latter seems at first to be only the reflection of consciousness into itself, a
representing not of an object but rather only of its knowing of that first
object. But as was previously shown, the first object is, to consciousness,
therebyaltered.Thefirstobjectceasestobethein-itselfand,toconscious-
ness,becomesthatwhichisonlythein-itselfforconsciousness.However,this
way there is this: the being-for-it of this in-itself, the true, which however
means that this is the essence, or itsobject. This new object contains the
nothingnessofthefirst;itiswhatexperiencehaslearnedaboutit.
87. In this exposition of the course of experience, there is a moment
throughwhichtheexpositionseems nottocorrespondwithwhatisordi-
narily understood by experience. The transition, namely, from the first
objectandtheknowingofittotheotherobjectaboutwhichonesaysthatit

58 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
objectthatweperhapscomeacrossserendipitouslyandextrinsicallysothat
theonlythinglefttousisthepuregraspingofwhatisinandforitself.How-
ever, based on the point of view given above, the new object shows itself
to have come to be through a reversal of consciousness itself. This observa-
tion of the matter is our addition, whereby the series of experiences tra-
versedbyconsciousnessiselevatedintoascientificprogression,andwhich
is not there for the consciousness that we are observing. However, this is
infactalsothesamesituationalreadydiscussedaboveconcerningtherela-
tion of this exposition to skepticism, namely, that each and every result
which emerges from a non-truthful knowing should not coalesce into an
empty nothing, but rather must be necessarily grasped as the nothing of
thatofwhichitistheresult,aresultwhichcontainsthetruththatthepre-
vious knowing has within itself. Here it presents itself as follows: While
what at first appeared as the object degenerating for consciousness into a
knowingoftheobject,andthein-itself becomesabeing-for-consciousnessof
the in-itself, this latter is the new object. As a result, a new shape of con-
sciousnesscomesonthesceneforwhichtheessenceissomethingdifferent

whichguidesthewholeseriesofshapesofconsciousnessintheirnecessity.
However,itisjustthisnecessityitself,ortheemergenceofthenewobject,

However,thecontentofwhatemergestousisforconsciousness,andwecom-
prehendonlywhatisformalinit,oritspureemergence.Forconsciousness,
what has emerged is only as object; for us, what has emerged at the same
timeemergesasmovementandcoming-to-be.
88. Through this necessity, this path to science is itself already science,

91. The concrete content of sensuous-certainty permits itself to appear
immediately as the richest cognition, indeed, as a knowing of an infinite
wealthforwhichnolimitistobefound,whetherweventureoutintothe

Rather,theitemis,anditis onlybecauseitis.Forsensuous-certaintythis
is what is essential, and this pure being, or this simple immediacy con-
stitutes its truth. Likewise, as a relation, certainty is an immediate, pure
relation. Consciousness is I, nothing further, a pure this, and thesingular

immediacy but also an example of it. Among all the countless differences
therebypoppingup,wefindineverycasethechiefdifference,namely,that
in that certainty both of the already noted “this’s,” namely, a this as an
I and a this as an object, precipitates all at once out of pure being. If we
reflect on this difference, it turns out that neither the one nor the other
is only immediately within sensuous-certainty; rather, both are mediated.
I have certainty through an other, namely, the item, and this likewise is
withincertaintythroughanother,namely,throughtheI.
93. It is not only we who make this difference of essence and exam-
ple,ofimmediacyandmediation.Rather,itisthatwefindthisdifference
in sensuous-certainty itself, and it is to be taken up in the form it has in
sensuous-certainty, not in the way we have just determined it to be. It is

the dialectic which it has in itself will take on a form as intelligible as the

“The‘now’isthenight.”Inordertoputthetruthofthissensuous-certainty

99. While this sensuous-certainty has proved in its own self that the
universal is the truth of its object, to it pure being therefore remains as its
essencebutnotasimmediate.Rather,itremainsasthattowhichnegation
and mediation are essential, and it thereby does not continue to be what

we mean by the term, “being.” Rather, what we mean is: Being with the
determination such that it is the abstraction, or the purely universal; and
what we mean to say, for which the truth of sensuous-certainty is not the
universal,isallthatremainsapartfromthisemptyorindifferentNowand

100. If we compare the relation in which knowing and the object first 66
came on the scene with the relations in which they come to stand in the
result,thentherelationhasreverseditself.Theobject,whichwassupposed
tobewhatwasessentialtosensuous-certainty,isnowtheinessential,since
the universal, which the object has come to be, is no longer the kind of
universal which the object was essentially supposed to be for sensuous-
certainty.Rather,sensuous-certaintyisnowpresentinwhatisopposedto

not yet thereby sublated. Rather, it is only pushed back into the I, and it
is still to be seen what experience will show us about sensuous-certainty’s
reality.
101. The force of its truth thus lies now in the I, in the immediacy
of my seeing, hearing, etc. The disappearance of the singular Now and
Here that we mean is deterred because I hold fast to them. Now is day-
time because I see it; here is a tree for precisely the same reason. However,
sensuous-certainty experiences in these relationships the same dialectic as
itdidwithintheprecedingrelationships.I,this,seethetreeandassertthe

Now and the Here and the I that I mean do not endure, or are not. We
thereby come to posit the whole of sensuous-certainty itself as its essence
and no longer only as a moment of sensuous-certainty, as happened in
both cases, in which at first the object opposed to the I and then the I
itself were each supposed to be the reality of sensuous-certainty. It is thus

We must let ourselves point to it, for the truth of this immediate relation
is the truth of this I which limits itself to a Now or to a Here. If we were
afterwards to take up this truth or to stand at a distance from it, it would

109. It is clear both that the dialectic of sensuous-certainty is noth-
ing but the simple history of its movement (that is, its experience) and
that sensuous-certainty itself is nothing but just this history. For that rea-
son, natural consciousness also proceeds to this result, what is the true in
69 sensuous-certainty,tokeeppressingeverforward.Itlearnsfromexperience
about it, but then it likewise forgets it again, and then it starts the whole
movement all over again right from the beginning. It is thus a bit aston-
ishing when, in the face of this experience, it is set up as a philosophical
assertion, or as a universal experience, or even as the outcome of skepti-
cism,thatthereality,orthebeing,ofexternalthingsasthis,orassensuous,
is to have absolute truth for consciousness. Such an assertion does not at
the same time know what it is saying; it does not know that it is saying
the opposite of what it wants to say. The truth of the sensuous This for
consciousnessissupposedtobeauniversalexperience,butinsteaditisthe
opposite which is a universal experience. Each consciousness again itself
sublates such a truth as, for example, here is a tree, ornow is midday, and
declares the opposite: Here is not a tree, but rather a house; and likewise
it again straightaway sublates the assertion which sublated the first asser-
tion as itself being only again an assertion of a sensuous This. What in
truth has been experienced in all of sensuous-certainty is only what we
haveseen,namely,thethisasauniversal,ortheveryoppositeofwhatthat
assertion assured us was the universal experience. – With this appeal to
universalexperience,wemaybepermittedtoanticipatesomeconcernsin
the practical sphere. In this respect, what one can say to those who make

the being of sensuous things, but rather arrives at despair about them. In
part he brings about their nothingness, and in part he sees them do it to
themselves. Nor are the animals excluded from this wisdom. Instead they

of the nullity of those things, they without any further ado simply help
themselves to them and devour them. Just like the animals, all of nature
celebrates these revealed mysteries which teach the truth about sensuous
things.

an aspect arises which must also be taken intoconsideration: Ifthe many

minate properties, for they are determinate properties only insofar as they
both differentiatethemselves from each other and relate themselves to each
other as opposites. However, according to this opposition, they could not
be together in the simple unity of their medium which is as essential to
them as is negation. Insofar as their difference within that unity does not
amount to an indifferent difference but rather to an excluding difference,
which itself amounts to a difference which negates others, so this differ-
encethusfallsoutsideofthissimplemedium.Thissimplemediumisnot
onlyanAlso,anindifferentunity;itisalsoaOne,anexcludingunity.–The
One is the moment of negation, as it itself relates itself to itself in a simple
way and excludes others and by which thinghood is determined as thing.

120. However, the diverse aspects which consciousness takes upon itself
aredeterminateinthateachisregardedasexistingforitselfwithintheuni-

121.Now,inthisperceiving,consciousnessisatthesametimeconscious
that it also reflects itself into itself and that in perceiving, the moment
opposed to the Also crops up. However, this moment is the unity of the
thing with itself which excludes difference from itself. It is accordingly
the unity that consciousness has to take upon itself, for the thing itself is
thestableexistenceofmanyvariousandindependentproperties.Itistherefore

asitiswhite,itisnotcubical,andinsofarasitiscubicalandalsowhite,it

to consciousness, which thus has to avoid letting them fall into a One in
thething.Tothatend,consciousnessbringsintoplaytheInsofarwhereby

waysothatwhatwascalledapropertyisnowrepresentedasafree-standing

itbecomesacollectionofmattersand,insteadofbeingaOne,itbecomes
merelyanenclosingsurface.
77 122. If we look back at what consciousness previously took upon itself
and look at what it now takes upon itself, or look at what it had previ-
ously ascribed to the thing and what it now ascribes to itself, it turns out
that it alternately makes itself, as well as the thing, into both a pure One

insofar as it is for itself is not for others. Yet, as consciousness has learned
from experience, oneness also corresponds to the thing itself; the thing is
essentiallyreflectedintoitself.TheAlso,ortheindifferentdifference,falls
just as much into the thing as it does into oneness, but since both are dif-
ferent,itdoesnotfallintothesamethingbutratherintodifferentthings.
The contradiction, which is per se in the objective essence, is distributed
intotwoobjects.Thethingthereforeisinandforitself,self-equal,butthis
unity with itself is disturbed through other things. In that way, the unity
of the thing is preserved and, at the same time, that otherness, which is

124.Now,tobesure,althoughthecontradictionintheobjectiveessence

therefore posited as each existing for itself, and the conflict falls into each
of them reciprocally such that each is different not from itself but only
from others. However, each is thereby itself determined as something dif-
ferent and has the essential difference from others in it,24 but at the same
time not in such a way that this would be an opposition in its own self. 79
Rather, it is for itself simple determinateness, which constitutes its essential
characteranddifferentiatesitfromothers.Sincediversityisinit,thesame
difference necessarily is as an actual difference of multiple constitutions
in it. Yet because the determinateness constitutes the essence of the thing,
whereby it distinguishes itself from others and is for itself, this otherwise
multipleconstitutionistheinessential.Withinitsunity,thethingthereby
has in itself the doubled Insofar, but withunequal values. As a result, its

up with an inessential, or an inessential which is nonetheless at the same
timenecessary,arethepowerswhoseplayistheperceptualunderstanding,

all the trouble of tenaciously clinging to one of them and asserting it to

then to set itself against the truth, it says that philosophy only deals with
thought-things.28 In fact, philosophy also deals with such thought-things,
andatthesametimeitiscognizant29 ofthemintheirdeterminatenessand
for that reason is master over them,30 whereas the perceiving understand-

through all material and content; they are the cohesiveness of and what

140. For the completion of the insight into the concept of this move-
ment,attentioncanbedrawntothefollowing.Thedifferencesthemselves
show themselves to be within a duplicated difference, at one time as dif-
ferences of content, while the one extreme is the force reflected into itself,
and the other extreme is the medium of the matters; at another time as
differences of form, while one solicits, the other is solicited, and the for-
mer is active, whereas the latter is passive. According to the difference of
content, they are as such, or for us, differentiated. However, according to
thedifferenceofformtheyareself-sufficientintheirrelationtoeachother,
separatingthemselvesofffromeachotherandopposingthemselvestoeach
other. That, according to both aspects, the extremes are nothing in them-
selves, but rather (within that which their differentiated essence ought to
stably exist) only vanishing moments, each an immediate transition into
87 the opposite, becomes for the consciousness in perception the movement
offorce.However,forus(asnotedabove),therewasalsostillthis:Inthem-
selvesthedifferencesvanishedasdifferencesofcontentandofformand,on

141. What results from all of this is that the concept of force becomes

nonetheless there is supposed to be something with which to fill it out,

saidthatthesupersensibleisnotappearance;but“appearance”thereisnot
understood to be appearance but rather to be the sensuous world as being

148. Our object, the understanding, is situated in this very place: To
itself,theinnerhasjustcometobeonlyastheuniversalwhichisstillnot

meaning that it does not exist in itself and the positive meaning only of

absolute exchange of determinateness which constitutes the sole content of

is the active, negative unity, or the One. All differences between the par-

ferences vanishing, the difference of forces likewise collapses in the same
way into one. There is therefore neither force, nor soliciting and being

149. Through its relation to the simplicity of the inner, or the under-

150. This realm of laws is, to be sure, the truth of the understanding,
which has its content in the difference that lies within the law. However,
it is at the same time only the understanding’s first truth and does not
completely bring appearance to its fulfillment. The law is now current in
appearance,butitisnottheentirepresenceofappearance;undereverdif-
ferent circumstances, the law has an ever different actuality. As a result,
there remains for appearance for itself an aspect which is not within the
inner;thatis,appearanceisintruthnotyetpositedasappearance,assub-
lated being-for-itself. This defect in the law must in its own self be like-
92 wise brought into prominence. What seems to be lacking in it is that it

itgoesbeyondthelawassuch.Thedeterminatenessthatwastalkedabout
isitselfreallyonlyavanishingmoment,whichnolongercomesintoview
here as an essentiality, for what is present here is only the law as the true.
However, the concept of the law is turned against the law itself. That is,
in the law, the difference itself is immediately grasped and incorporated
into the universal, and as a result there is in the law a stable existence of
themoments,whoserelationthelawexpresses,asindifferentessentialities 93
existing in themselves. However, these parts of the difference in the law
areatthesametimethemselvesdeterminateaspects.Thepureconceptof

thatwithinit,astheabsolutelysimple,thedifferences,whicharepresentin
thelawassuch,themselvesreturnagainintotheinnerassimpleunity.The
simpleunityistheinnernecessityofthelaw.
152. As a result, the law is present in a doubled manner, at one time
as a law in which the differences are expressed as self-sufficient moments,
and at another time in the form of simple being-that-has-returned-into-
itself.45 This again can be called force, but not in such a way that it is the
force driven back but rather so that it is the force as such, or the concept
offorce,whichisitselfanabstractionandwhichitselfdrawsintoitselfthe
differencesbetweenwhatattractsandwhatisattracted.Forexample,simple
electricity is in that way force. However, the expression of the difference
belongs in the law, and this difference is positive and negative electricity.
In the movement of falling, force is the simple, or gravity, for which the
law is that the magnitudes of the distinct moments of the motion, or the
time elapsed and the space traversed, relate themselves to each other as
root and square. Electricity itself is not the difference in itself, or is not

153.Theindifferenceoflawandforce,orofconceptandbeing,ispresent
in yet another way than that already indicated. In the law of motion, for
example, it is necessary that motion be divided into time and space, or
else then into distance and velocity. While motion is only the relation of
thosemoments,motion,ortheuniversal,isheredividedinitself.However,
theseparts,timeandspace,ordistanceandvelocity,donotnowexpressin

space, and distance at least without velocity – in the same way that their
magnitudes are indifferent to each other while they do not relate to each
otheraspositiveandnegativeandthusarenotrelatedtoeachotherthrough
their essence. Thus, there is of course the necessity of division but not the
necessityofthepartsassuchforeachother.However,forthatreason,that

where any one of them can be just as well without the other. Motion is

infinity itself, but infinity first freely emerges as explanation. As infinity
is finally an object for consciousness, and consciousness is aware of it
as what it is, so is consciousness self-consciousness. The explanation pro-
videdbytheunderstandingatfirstconstitutesonlythedescriptionofwhat
self-consciousness is. The understanding sublates the differences already 101

However, this movement, or this necessity, is in this way still a necessity
and a movement of the understanding, or as such it is not the understand-
ing’s object. Rather, within that movement, the understanding has for its
objects positive and negative electricity, distance, velocity, force of attrac-
tion,andathousandotherthings,objectswhichconstitutethecontentof
the moments of the movement. It is just for that reason that there is so
much self-satisfaction in explanation, because the consciousness involved

B. Self-Consciousness
iv. the truth of self-certainty
103 166. In the preceding kinds of certainty, the truth for consciousness is
something other than consciousness itself. However, the concept of this
truthvanishesintheexperienceofit.Thewaytheobjectimmediatelywas
in itself, as sensuous-certainty’s entity, perception’s concrete thing, or the
understanding’s force, proves not to be the way it is in truth. Rather, this

of itself, in relation to what has come before, knowing of an other, then
the latter knowing has, to be sure, vanished. However, at the same time
its moments have likewise been preserved, and the loss consists in this,
that those moments are present here as they are in-themselves. Thebeing 104
ofwhatwasmeant,alongwiththesingularityandtheuniversalityopposed
to that singularity in perception, as well as the empty inner of the under-
standing, no longer are as the essence. Rather, they are only as moments

thereturnfromoutofotherness.Asself-consciousness,itismovement,but
while self-consciousness only distinguishes itself from itself as itself, that
difference as an otherness is, to itself, immediately sublated. There simply
is no difference, and self-consciousness is only the motionless tautology of
“I am I.” While, to itself, the difference does not also have the shape of
being, it is not self-consciousness. Otherness thereby is for it as a being,
or as a distinguished moment, but, for it, it is also the unity of itself with
this difference as a second distinguished moment. With that first moment,
self-consciousnessisasconsciousness,andthewholebreadthofthesensuous
worldispreservedforit,butatthesametimeonlyasrelatedtothesecond
moment, the unity of self-consciousness with itself. The sensuous world
is thereby for it a stable existence, which is, however, only appearance, or
isthedifferencewhichin-itself hasnobeing.Butthisoppositionbetween
its appearance and its truth has only the truth for its essence, namely, the
unity of self-consciousness with itself. This unity must become essential
toself-consciousness,whichistosay,self-consciousnessisdesire,fullstop.1
Asself-consciousness,consciousnesshenceforthhasadoubledobject:The
first, the immediate object, the object of sensuous-certainty and percep-
tion, which, however, is marked for it with the character of the negative;
the second, namely, itself, which is the true essence and which at the out-
set is present only in opposition to the first. Self-consciousness exhibits
itself therein as the movement within which this opposition is sublated,
andwithinwhich,toitself,theequalityofitselfwithitselfcomestobe.

fluidity itself becomes the other, since it now is for the difference which is
in and for itself and which is thus the infinite movement by which that
peaceful medium is consumed. As such, it is life as living things. – How-
ever, this inversion is for that reason again invertedness in-itself. What is
consumed is the essence, and as a result, individuality, in preserving itself

As a result, both aspects of the entire movement, which had been distin-
guished, collapse into one another. Namely, it is the shapes motionlessly
elaborated in the universal medium of self-sufficiency and the process of
life which collapse into one another. The latter, the process of life, is just
as much a taking shape4 as it is the sublating of the shape, and the for-
107 mer, the taking shape, is just as much a sublating as it is a division into
groupings. The fluid element is itself only the abstraction of essence, or
it is only actual as a shape. That it divides itself into groupings is again

these moments. Rather, it is the whole developing itself, then dissolving
its development, and, in this movement, being the simple self-sustaining
whole.

as the sort of certainty which, to itself, has come to be in an objective

in the first place because it gets itself back through sublation, for it comes

However, in the second place, it likewise gives the other self-consciousness

182. In this way, this movement of self-consciousness in its relation to 110

184. In this movement we see the process repeat itself which had been
exhibited as the play of forces in consciousness. What existed for us in
that process is here for the extremes themselves. The mediating middle is
self-consciousness,whichdisintegratesintotheextremes,andeachextreme
term is this exchange of its own determinateness and the absolute transi-
tion into what is its opposite. However, as consciousness, it does indeed

the existing object has here been determined to be life – which for each
other have not yet achieved the movement of absolute abstraction, they
havenotyetachievedthedestructionofallimmediatebeingandofbeing

they have not yet presented themselves to each other as pure being-for-
itself, which is to say, as self-consciousness. Each is, to be sure, certain of
itselfbutnotoftheother,andforthatreasonitsowncertaintyofitselfis
still without truth, for its truth would be only if its own being-for-itself
were, to itself, to have exhibited itself as a self-sufficient object, or, what
is the same thing, that the object would have turned out to be this pure
certainty of itself. However, according to the concept of recognition, this

188. However, this trial by death likewise sublates the truth which was
supposed to emerge from it, and, by doing so, completely sublates the
certainty of itself. For just as life is thenatural location of consciousness,
self-sufficiency without absolute negativity, death is the natural negation
of this same consciousness, negation without self-sufficiency, which thus
endureswithoutthesignificanceoftherecognitionwhichwasdemanded.

ately to both, and (b) mediately to each through the other. The master
relates himself to the servant mediately through self-sufficient being, for it is
on this very point that the servant is held fast. It is his chain, the one he

in the struggle that to him it only counted as a negative. While he is the
poweroverthisbeing,thisbeing,however,isthepowerovertheother,so
that the master thus has within this syllogism the other as subordinate to
him. Themaster likewise relates himself to the thing mediatelythrough the
servant. The servant, as self-consciousness itself, relates himself negatively
tothethingandsublatesthething.However,atthesametimethethingis
for him self-sufficient, and, for that reason, he cannot through his negat-
ing be over and done with it, cannot have eliminated it; or, the servant
onlyprocessesit.Ontheotherhand,tothemaster,theimmediaterelation
comes to be through this mediation as the pure negation of the thing, or
as the consumption of the thing. Where desire had failed, the master now
succeeds in being over and done with the thing, and he achieves satisfac-
tion in his consumption of it. On account of the thing’s self-sufficiency,
desire did not achieve this much, but the master, who has interposed
the servant between the thing and himself, as a result only links up with

In both moments, he cannot achieve mastery over existence and achieve

hedestroysthisaliennegativeandpositshimself assuchanegativewithin
the element of continuance. He thereby becomes for himself an existing-
being-for-itself. Being-for-itself in the master is to the servant an other,
or it is only for him. In fear, being-for-itself is in its own self. In cultur-
ally formative activity,19 being-for-itself becomes for him his own being-
for-itself, and he attains the consciousness that he himself is in and for
himself. As a result, the form, by being posited as external, becomes to
himnotsomethingotherthanhimself,forhispurebeing-for-itselfisthat
very form, which to him therein becomes the truth. Therefore, through
thisretrieval,hecomestoacquirethroughhimselfamindofhisown,and
he does this precisely in the work in which there had seemed to be only
some outsider’s mind. – For this reflection, the two moments of fear and
service, as well as the moments of culturally formative activity are both
necessary, and both are necessary in a universal way. Without the disci-
pline of service and obedience, fear is mired in formality and does not
diffuse itself over the conscious actuality of existence. Without culturally
formative activity, fear remains inward and mute, and consciousness will
notbecomeforit[consciousness]itself.20 Ifconsciousnessengagesinfor-
mative activity without that first, absolute fear, then it has a mind of its
ownwhichisonlyvanity,foritsform,oritsnegativity,isnotnegativityin
itself, andhis formative activity thus cannot tohimself give him the con-
sciousness of himself as consciousness of the essence. If he has not been

every one of the ways in which his natural consciousness was brought to
fulfillment was shaken to the core, he is still attached in himself to deter-
minate being. His having a mind of his own is then only stubbornness, a

197. On the one hand, to the self-sufficient self-consciousness, its essence
is only the pure abstraction of the I. However, on the other hand, while
this abstract I develops itself and gives itself differences, this differenti-
ating does not become, to itself, an objective essence existing-in-itself.
This self-consciousness thus does not become an I that is genuinely self-
distinguished in its simplicity, or a self-consistent I21 within this absolute
difference.Incontrast,pressedbackintoitselfandastheformofthecul-

the concept as an abstraction has here cut itself off from the manifoldness

120 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
201.Inthewayithasdetermineditselfasabstractfreedom,thisthink-
ing consciousness is therefore only the incomplete negation of other-
ness. Having only pulled itself back into itself from out of existence, it
has not in itself achieved itself as the absolute negation of this existence.
119 To be sure, the content counts to it only as thought, but thereby also
as determinate thought and at the same time determinateness as such
determinateness.
202. Skepticism is the realization of that of which stoicism is only the
concept – and it is the actual experience of what freedom of thought is.
Skepticismisinitself thenegative,andthatisthewayitmustexhibititself.
Withthereflectionofself-consciousnessintothesimplethoughtsofitself,
self-sufficient existence, or the lasting determinateness confronting it, has
in fact fallen outside of the infinity of thought. In skepticism, the whole
inessentiality and non-self-sufficiency of this other comes to be for con-
sciousness; thought becomes the thinking that annihilates the being of the
manifoldlydeterminateworld,andthenegativityoffreeself-consciousness
intheheartofthesemultifariousshapesoflifebecomes,toitself,realneg-
ativity. – It is clear that just as stoicism corresponds to the concept of self-
sufficientconsciousness(whichappearedasarelationshipbetweenmastery
andservitude),skepticismcorrespondstotherealizationoftheconceptof
self-sufficientconsciousnessasthenegativedirection(ofdesireandwork)

the negation for self-consciousness, by contrast this polemical direction
towardsthemanifoldself-sufficiencyofthingsmeetswithsuccessbecause,
withinitself,asanalreadyculminatedandfreeself-consciousness,itturns
against them. Toput itmore precisely, because thispolemical orientation
has thinking in its own self, or infinity, those self-sufficiencies, according
to their differences, are therein only as vanishing magnitudes to it. The
differences which in the pure thinking of itself are only the abstraction of
differencesbecomehereallofthedifferences,andeverydifferentiatedbeing
becomesadifferenceofself-consciousness.
203. Thereby what skepticism as such does, as well as its way of doing
it, determines what skepticism is. It highlights the dialectical movement,
whichissensuous-certainty,perception,andtheunderstanding,aswellas

204.Thedialectical,asnegativemovementinthewaythatsuchmove-
ment immediately is, initially appears to consciousness as something to
which consciousness must give way and which does not exist through
consciousness itself. In contrast, as skepticism, it is a moment of self-
consciousness, to which it does not simply happen that the true and the 120
real for it vanishes without its knowing how this comes about. Rather, it
iswhat,withinthecertaintyofitsfreedom,letsthisother,whichisgiving

both as given to itself by itself and as sustained by itself to itself; it is this
Ataraxia[indifference]ofthought-thinking-itself,26 theunchangeableand
genuine certainty of its own self. This certainty does not emerge from an
alien source whose multifarious development would have collapsed into
itself, nor does it emerge as a result which would have its coming-to-
be firmly behind it. Rather, consciousness itself is the absolute dialecti-
cal unrest, this mixture of sensuous representations and representational
thought, whose differences collapse into each other and whose equality –

is what it is for itself, for it itself sustains and engenders this self-moving
disarray. For that reason, it avows that it is an entirely contingent singu-
larlyindividualconsciousness–aconsciousnesswhichisempirical,which
orients itself according to what has no reality for it, which obeys what is
not essential for it, and which acts on and actualizes what has no truth

vidual, as contingent, and in fact, as both animal life and as forsaken self-
consciousness, it also, on the contrary, makes itself again into universal
self-equal self-consciousness, for it is the negativity of all singular individ-
uality and all difference. From this self-equality, or from within itself, it
instead falls back once again into that contingency and disarray, for this
self-moving negativity has to do solely with what is singularly individual,

206. In skepticism, consciousness experiences itself in truth as a self-
contradictoryconsciousness.Fromoutofthisexperience,therethenarises
anewshapewhichbringstogetherthetwothoughtswhichskepticismkeeps
asunder. Skepticism’s thoughtlessness about itself has to vanish because
it is in fact one consciousness that has these two modes in it. This new
shape is thereby one that isfor itself the doubled consciousness of itself
asself-liberating,unchangeable,self-equalself-consciousness,andofitself
as absolutely self-confusing, self-inverting – and it is the consciousness of
itsbeingthiscontradiction.–Instoicism,self-consciousnessisthesimple
freedom of itself; in skepticism, it realizes itself and annihilates the other
aspect of determinate existence, but on the contrary it doubles itself and
is, to itself, now something twofold. The doubling, which was previously
distributed between two singular individuals, the master and the servant,
is thereby brought back into one singular individual. Although the dou-
bling of self-consciousness within itself, which is essential in the concept
of spirit, is thereby present, its unity is not yet present, and the unhappy
consciousnessistheconsciousnessofitselfasadoubled,onlycontradictory
creature.28
207.Because,toitself,thiscontradictionofitsessenceisoneconscious- 122
ness,thisunhappyandestrangedconsciousnesswithinitself alsomustalways
have in one consciousness that of an other consciousness. But just when
it thinks itself to have achieved victory and to have achieved restful unity
with the other consciousness, each must again be immediately expelled
from the unity. However, its true return into itself, or its reconciliation
with itself, will exhibit the concept of the spirit that has been brought to
life and has entered into existence, because in it, as one undivided con-
sciousness, it is already a doubled consciousness. It itself is the beholding
of a self-consciousness in an other; it itself is both of them; and, to itself,
the unity of both is also the essence. However, for itself it is, to itself, not
yetthisessenceitself,norisityettheunityofboth.

again not this essence. The stance that it assigns to both thus cannot be
anindifferenceofonetotheother,i.e.,cannotbeanindifferenceofitself
with respect to the unchangeable. Rather, it is immediately itself both of
them, and, for it, it is the relation of both as a relation of essence to the
inessential, in such a manner that this latter is to be sublated. However,
while both are, to itself, equally essential and equally contradictory, it is
only the contradictory movement in which the opposite does not come
to rest in its own opposite but instead newly engenders itself only as an
oppositewithinit.
209. As a result, there is a struggle against an enemy in which victory

However, this observation, insofar as it is made by us, is ill-timed here,

215. If therefore at first it is taken to be pure consciousness, then while

opposite.
216. However, even though the unhappy consciousness does not there-
fore have this presence in its possession, it is at the same time high above
pure thinking insofar as it is stoicism’s abstract thinking turning a blind
eye to singular individuality altogether and is the only unsettled and agi-
tatedthinkingofskepticism–whichisindeedonlysingularindividuality
both as the unconscious contradiction and the unremitting movement of
that contradiction. – It transcends both of these; it both brings together

launches itself in the direction of thinking, and on that path it becomes
devotion.30 As such, its thinking remains that of the shapeless roar of the

on the scene in that way, this object does not make its entrance as con-
ceptualized,andforthatreasonitcomesonthesceneassomethingalien.
What is thereby present is the inward movement of the pure heart which
painfully feels itself as estranged. It is the movement of an infinite longing
which is certain that its essence is that of a pure heart, that it is a pure
thinking that thinks of itself as singular individuality, and that this object

128 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
takes cognizance of it31 and bestows recognition on it for the very reason
that this object thinks of itself as singular individuality. However, at the
same time this essence is the unattainable other-worldly beyond which, in

for it is just supposed to be an other-worldly beyond, or the kind of thing
that cannot be found. Sought as individual, it turns out not to be a uni-
versalsingularindividualityofthought,32 oritturnsoutnottobeaconcept
but rather to be the singular individual as an object, or as an actuality, an
object of immediate sense certainty. Just for that reason, it thus turns out

218. However, initially the return of the heart into itself is to be taken
in the sense that, to itself, it is the heart which has singularly individual
actuality.Itisthepureheartforus,orinitself,whichhasfounditselfand

ofdesireandlabor,whichtoconsciousnesshasprovenitselftobetheinner
certaintyofconsciousnessitself,acertaintyithadachievedforusthrough
the sublation and the consumption of the alien essence, specifically, of
that essence in the form of self-sufficient things. However, the unhappy
consciousness is to be found only as desiring and laboring consciousness; it
is not in a position to find itself so that its inner certainty of itself would
be its ground, nor so that its feeling of the essence would be only this
feeling of its own self.34 While it does not have that certainty for itself, its
innernessstillremainsinsteadashatteredself-certainty.Itsprovingitsown 127
worth,35whichitwouldobtainthroughworkandconsumption,isforthat
reason just the same shattered proof of its worth; or instead it must itself
do away with this proof of its worth so that it finds such a proof on its
own, but only the proof of the worth of what it is for itself, namely, its
estrangement.
219. The actuality which desire and work turn against is for this con-
sciousness no longer something which is null in itself, something only to
be sublated and consumed by that consciousness. Rather, it is something
like consciousness itself, an actuality at odds with itself,36 which in one

220. However much consciousness were for itself self-sufficient con-
sciousness,andhowevermuchactualitywere,toitself,inandforitselfnull,
stillinworkandconsumption,consciousnesswouldarriveatthefeelingof
its own self-sufficiency, and as a result, it would then itself be that which
wouldsublateactuality.However,whilethisactualityis,toitself,theshape
oftheunchangeable,consciousnessisnotonitsowncapableofsublating
that actuality, but rather, while consciousness does indeed arrive at anni-
hilating actuality and consuming it, what essentially happens for it as a
result is that the unchangeable itself surrenders its shape and hands it over
to consciousness to consume. – For its part, consciousness likewise comes
on the scene as what is actual, but, just as much, as internally shattered.

130 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
consciousness as such. However, it is therein also in itself, and this aspect
belongs to the unchangeable other-worldly beyond. They are the abilities
and powers, an alien gift, which the unchangeable likewise hands over to
consciousnesstomakeuseof.
221. Accordingly, in its doing, consciousness is initially in relationships
between two extremes. On one side, it is positioned as an active this-
worldliness,confrontedbypassiveactuality[ontheotherside].Botharein
relationtoeachother,butbothalsohavereturnedintotheunchangeable,
whereeachinitselftenaciouslyclingstoitself.Hence,itisinbothaspects

becauseitisitsunchangeableessenceitselfwhichsublatesit,whichrepels
itselffromitself,andwhichsurrenderswhatithasrepelledtotheactivity.
The active force appears as the power in which actuality is dissolved. This
128 consciousness is that to which the in-itself, or the essence, is, to itself, an
other, and for this reason, this power, which is how consciousness enters
into doing, is for this consciousness the other-worldly beyond of itself.
Therefore, instead of making an inward return into itself from out of its
doing, and instead of having itself proven its worth for itself, conscious-
ness instead reflects this movement of doing into the other extreme. This
otherextremetherebyshowsupaswhatispurelyuniversal,astheabsolute
powerwhichwasthestartingpointforamovementinalldirections.Itis
supposedtobetheessenceoftheself-corrodingextremesbothintheway
thattheyfirstmadetheirappearanceandinthefluxitself.
222. The unchangeable consciousness relinquishes its shape and sur-
renders it, and, in exchange, the singular individual consciousness gives
thanks, i.e., denies itself the satisfaction of the consciousness of its self-
sufficiencyandassignstheessenceofitsdoingnottoitselfbuttotheother-
worldly beyond. From both of these moments of reciprocal self-surrender
on both sides, its unity with the unchangeable emerges. However, at the
same time, this unity is affected by division, and it is again broken up
within itself. It is from out of this unity that the opposition of universal
and singular again comes on the scene. To be sure, consciousness makes
ashowofrenouncingthesatisfactionofitsownself-feeling.37 However,it
achievestheactualsatisfactionofthatself-feeling,foritisdesire,work,and
consumption; as consciousness, it has willed, acted, andconsumed. Its

B.Self-Consciousness 131
giving thanks, in which it recognizes the other extreme as the essence
and thus sublates itself, is likewise its own doing, which offsets the other
extreme’sdoingandcounterstheself-surrenderingfavorwithanequalact.

onlyinactualdesire,labor,andconsumption,buteveninitsverygivingof
thanks,adoinginwhichtheveryoppositeseemstotakeplace.Thatis,the
whole movement is reflected off into the extreme of singular individuality.
Consciousness therein feels itself to be this singular individual conscious-
ness,anditdoesnotletitselfbedeceivedbyitsownshowofrenunciation,

Itisalsotherepeatedfissureintheself-renunciationitselfwhichconfronts

223. The third relationship in the movement of this consciousness has
thereby come on the scene. This third relationship follows from the sec-
ondandhasintruth,throughitswillingandthroughitsaccomplishment,
putitselftothetestasself-sufficientconsciousness.Inthefirstrelationship,
it was only theconcept of actual consciousness, or the inner heart, which
was not yet actual in doing and in consumption. The second is this actu- 129
alization as external doing and as consuming. However, having returned
from out of all of this, consciousness is now such that it has experienced

However, this suppression is in truth a return of consciousness back into
itself,namely,intoitself,toitself,asthegenuineactuality.
224. This third relationship, in which this genuine actuality is one
extreme, is the relation of this actuality as nullity to the universal essence.

ever, while this enemy engenders itself in its very suppression, conscious-
ness, by fixating itself on the enemy, is instead continually dwelling on it
instead of freeing itself from it. It continually sees itself as polluted, and,
at the same time, the content of its strivings, instead of being something
essential, is the very lowest, and instead of being a universal, is the most
singular.Whatweseehereisonlyapersonalitylimitedtoitselfanditsown

226.However,inboththefeelingofitsunhappinessandinthepoverty
of its acts, consciousness just as much binds itself to its unity with the
unchangeable.Fortheattemptedimmediateannihilationofitsactualbeing
is mediated through the thought of the unchangeable, and it takes place
within this relation. The mediated relation constitutes the essence of the

227.Thismediatedrelationistherebyasyllogisminwhichsingularindi-
viduality, which had initially fixed on itself as opposed to the in-itself, is
130 merged with this other extreme only through a third. It is through this
mediating middle that the extreme of unchangeable consciousness is for
theinessentialconsciousness.Atthesametimeintheinessentialconscious-
ness, there is also the following. The inessential consciousness is just as
much supposed to be for the unchangeable consciousness only through
the mediating middle, and this mediating middle is thereby what both
presents38thetwoextremestoeachotherandisthemutualservantofeach
for the other. This mediating middle is itself a conscious essence, for it is
a doing which mediates consciousness as such. The content of this doing

B.Self-Consciousness 133
is what consciousness is undertaking, namely, the erasure of its singular
individuality.
228. Within the mediating middle, this consciousness frees itself from
doing and consumption as what are its own. As an extreme existing-for-
itself, it repels from itself the essence of its will, and it shifts over to the
mediatingterm,ortotheservant,theveryownnessofitsdecisionsandits
freedom and, with that, any blame39 for its own acts. Since this mediator

renouncesitasbeingexternalproperty–whileitgivesupsomethingofthe
possession it has acquired through its labor. And in part, it renounces its
consumption – while in its fastings and its mortifications, it again denies
itselfthatconsumption.
229. Through these moments of first surrendering its own decision,
thensurrenderingitspropertyandconsumption,finally,throughthepos-
itive moment of carrying out a task it does not understand, it deprives
itself in truth and completely of the consciousness of inner and outer
freedom, of actuality as its being-for-itself. It has the certainty of having
in truth emptied40 itself of its I, and of having made its immediate self-
consciousness into a thing, into an objective being. – It could prove the
worthofitsself-renunciationsolelybythisactualsacrifice,foronlyinthat
sacrifice does the deception vanish which lies in the inner recognition of
giving thanks through the heart and through one’s disposition and one’s
speech. In that self-renunciation, there is a bestowal of recognition that
shifts all the power of being-for-itself away from itself and instead treats
this power as a gift from above. However, in this very shifting, it itself
retains its external ownness in the possession which it does not give up,
and it retains its inner ownness both in the consciousness of the decision

that as consciousness, which comes on the scene as reason and immediately
has that certainty in itself, so too does idealism immediately give expres-
siontothatcertainty.IamI,inthesensethattheI,whichisanobjectfor
me, is not as it is within self-consciousness in general, where it was there
only as an empty object, nor as it is within free self-consciousness, where
hereitisjustanobjectthatwithdrawsitselffromotherswhichnonetheless
still count as valid alongside it. Rather, it is an object with the conscious-
ness of the non-being of anything that is other. It is a singular object; it is
all reality and presence. However, not only is self-consciousness for itself
all reality; it is also in itself all reality, as a result of its becoming this real-
ity, or, instead by proving itself to be this reality. It initially proves itself
to be this in the very path along which otherness vanishes in the dialecti-

the determinateness for consciousness of being, the other in which it had
the determinateness of only being for consciousness. However, both were
reduced down to one truth, namely, that what is, or thein-itself, is only
insofar as it is for consciousness, and that what is for consciousness is also
what is in itself. The consciousness that is this truth has this path behind
it and has forgotten it while it immediately comes on the scene as reason.
Or this reason, as immediately coming on the scene, does so only as the
certainty of that truth. It only gives the assurance of being all reality, but
does not itself comprehend this, for the comprehension of this immedi-
ately expressed assertion is that forgotten path itself. Likewise, when one

consciousness as being all reality and immediately makes it the essence,

thereby constitute itself as the negative unity of the differences. However,

However, these others of this category are only other categories mentioned
for the first time, namely, pure essentiality andpure difference, and in this
category, i.e., in the very positedness of the other, or in this other itself,
consciousness is equally itself. Each of these different moments points to
anothermoment,butatthesametime,withineachofthem,thereisnever
any otherness at all. The pure category refers to the species, which passes
over into the negative category, or into individuality. However, this latter
refers back to them; it is itself pure consciousness which within each of
them remains this clear unity with itself. However, this clear unity with
itselfisjustasmuchdirectedtoanother,which,whileitis,hasvanished,

that difference, diverse being, is to become for the I what is its own, that

an earlier point have perfected itself in its own self in order to be able to

reason, but reason as such is not yet, to itself, the object. However much
itwerelikewisetoknowreasontobetheessenceofthingsandtheessence

consciousness in its own distinctive shape, it would still instead descend
into its own depths and look for reason there rather than in things. If it

therefore concerns itself with things, supposing that it is taking them in

aretakenfromtheirclawsandteeth.Indeed,notonlydoescognitiondis-
tinguish one animal from another by this means, but it is by these means
that the animal itself separates itself off from others. It is through these

For the distinguishing mark, the universal determinateness, is the unity

Observation, which kept them apart in orderly fashion and believed that

248.Inrestrictingitselftothesimpleortosensuousdistractionsthrough
theuniversal,thisrestrictiveobservingthusfindsinitsobjectthedisarray
of its own principle because what is determinate must by its very nature
lose itself in its opposite. On those very grounds, reason must progress
instead from inert determinateness, which had the semblance of lasting,
to the observation of what such determinateness is in truth, namely, its
relating itself to its opposite. What are called essential distinguishing marks 142
are motionless determinatenesses, which, as they express themselves and
astheyaregraspedassimple,donotexhibitwhatconstitutestheirnature,
namely,tobevanishingmomentsofthatmovementtakingitselfbackinto

distinguishingmarks,itsearchesforthelawandtheconceptsofthosedeter-
minatenesses. It does this according to the determinateness of the nature
of those distinguishing marks, which for each of them essentially consists
in not existing for itself but in passing over into its opposite. To be sure,
it searches for them just as much as existing actuality, but, to itself, this
actualitywillinfactdisappear,andtheaspectsofthelawwillbecomepure
moments, or abstractions, such that the law itself comes to light in the
nature of the concept, which has abolished in itself the indifferent stable
existenceofsensuousactuality.
249. To observing consciousness, the truth of the law is in experience in
the way that sensuous being is for it, which is to say, it is not in and for
itself.Howevermuchthelawdoesnothaveitstruthintheconcept,stillit
issomethingcontingentandnotanecessity,ornotreallyalaw.However,
that the law’s being as a concept not only does not conflict with its being
available for observation but for that very reason is instead in possession
of necessary existence, and it is for observation. The universal in the sense
of a rational universality is also the universal in the previous sense of its
exhibitingitselfforthatconsciousnessaswhatiscurrentandactual,orthe
conceptpresentsitselfinthemodeofthinghoodandsensuousbeing–but
without for that reason losing its nature and falling back down into inert
stable existence or indifferent succession. What is universally valid is also
148 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
whatisuniversallyeffective:15 Whatoughttobeisalsoinfactwhatis,and
what only should be, but is not, has no real truth. The instinct of reason
remains in the right when it stands firm on this point and when it does
not allow itself to be led into error by intellectual fantasies16 which only
ought to be, and which, as what ought to be, are supposed to be true even
if they have never been encountered in any experience at all – it does not

law, but it likewise has it there as concept, and only on account of both
circumstances together is the law true, to itself. The law counts as law
becauseitexhibitsitselfinappearanceandatthesametimeisinitselfthe

251.Becauseatthesametimethelawisinitselftheconcept,theinstinct
of reason of this consciousness necessarily sets itself to purifying the law
and its moments into concepts but without knowing that this is what it
wants to do, and it thus sets up experiments about the law. As the law at

being,andtheconceptwhichconstitutesitsnatureexhibitsitselfassunken
intoempiricalmaterial.Initsexperiments,theinstinctofreasonsetsitself
tofindingoutwhatfollowsinsuchandsuchcircumstances.Thelawseems
thereby only tobe immersed even more in sensuous being, yet in all this,
this sensuous being is instead lost. The inner significance of this research
is that it finds the pure conditions of the law, and even if the conscious-
ness expressing this should think that by doing so it is saying something
different, it is saying that it is supposed to elevate the law entirely into
theconceptandtodoawaywithallthelinksitsmomentshavetodetermi-

significance and become purely positive and negative electricity, neither of

On account of this self-sufficiency, they therefore are given the names of

the organic and the elemental are not really to be called laws, for in part
such a relation, according to its content, does not in any way exhaust the
range of the organic, and in part the moments of the relation themselves
remain indifferent to each other and express no necessity. In the concept

a result of the fact that through the change, which the doing undertook,
nothing else emerges other than what was already there. Or, if we begin

this doing has in it the character of singular individuality. However, this
purposive doing as such would not measure up to the organic insofar as
thedoinghasthecharacterofuniversalityandinsofarasthedoingitselfis
posited as the same as what as a result is engendered by it. That singular

efficaciousness is here under examination is posited as a thing preserving
itself in its relation to its opposite; the activity as such is nothing but the
pureessencelessformofitsbeing-for-itself,anditssubstance,whichisnot
bare determinate being but rather the universal, its purpose, does not fall
outside the bounds of the activity. In its own self, the activity is an activ-
ityinwardlyturningbackintoitself,notanactivityledbackintoitselfby

261. However, for that reason this unity of universality and activity is
not for this observing consciousness because that unity is essentially the
innermovementoftheorganicandcanonlybegraspedasconcept.How-
ever, observing seeks the moments in the form of being and endurance,
and because the organic whole is essentially that which does not have the
moments in it nor lets them be found in it, consciousness transforms the

where outside the bounds of what is existing. Rather, the organic being33 is
laid as the foundation, or as undivided and as the content of inner and

a purely formal opposition, whose real aspects have the same in-itself for

least the first two, do not indeed seem to refer to organisms as such but
onlytotheanimalorganism.Thevegetableorganisminfactexpressesonly
the simple concept of the organism which does not develop its moments.
Hence, in considering those moments insofar as they are supposed to be
for observation, we must hold ourselves fast to what it is that puts the
developedexistenceofthosemomentsondisplay.
266.Asforwhatnowconcernsthesemomentsthemselves,thefollowing
can be said. They immediately follow from the concept of what has itself
as a purpose,35 for sensibility as such expresses the simple concept of an
organic reflective turn into itself, or the universal fluidity of this concept.
However,irritabilityexpressesorganicelasticity,theorganism’sconducting

theactualizationinwhichtheformerabstractbeing-for-itselfisabeingfor
others, an actualization which is in opposition to that initial motionless

267.Theothersignificanceoftheseorganicelements,namely,asthesig-
nificance of the outer, is the mode in which they are shaped, according to
which these organic elements are present as actual but at the same time
universal parts, or as organic systems. Sensibility takes the shape, say, of a
nervous system, irritability, that of a muscular system, and reproduction,
that of an intestinal system for the preservation of the individual and the
species.

legislation is not tied to organic moments; rather, it can be played every-

154 273. Finally, if instead of sensibility and irritability, reproduction is
brought into relation with one or other of them, then the motivation for

rests on this opposition, the mere semblance of its taking place also falls
away.

cept are here regarded is theproper immediate externality of the inner. It
is not the outer, which is the outer of the whole and is the shape. In what
follows,theinneristobeconsideredinrelationtothatouter.
275. However, if the opposition of the moments is grasped as it is in
existence itself, then sensibility, irritability, and reproduction subside into
being ordinary properties, which are universals that are just as indifferent
towards one another as are specific weight, color, hardness, and so on. In
thissense,itcanindeedbeobservedthatoneorganicbeingcouldbesaidto

indifferencetoeachotherandinexhibitingthefreedomofnatureunbound

276. The other aspect is that according to which the simple moments
oftheorganicconceptarecomparedwiththemomentsofitsshaping,and
it would only issue the real law which would express the true outer as the 155
imprint of the inner. – Now, because those simple moments are perme-
ating, fluid properties, they do not have a kind of segregated, real expres-
sion in organic things as what is called the singular system of the shape.
Or, however much the abstract idea of the organism is truly expressed in
those three moments, if only for the reason that they are nothing stable
and are rather only moments of the concept and of the movement, still

ofreproduction.Inthesystemsconstitutingashapeassuch,theorganism
is understood according to the abstract side of dead existence; taken in
that way, its moments belong to anatomy and to the cadaver, not to cog-
nition and the living organism. As those kinds of parts, they have in fact
ceased to be, for they cease to be processes. Since the being of an organ-
ism is essentially universality, or the reflective turn into itself, the being
of its whole, like its moments, cannot consist in an anatomical system.
Rather,theactualexpressionofthewholeandexternalityofthemoments
are instead only present as a movement that runs throughout the various
partsoftheshaping,andwithinwhichwhatistornoutandrigidlysetup

whatcanbecountedastheirrealityisnottheformeractualityintheway
anatomy finds it; rather, what counts as their reality is only that actuality

277. It therefore turns out that neither the moments of the organically
inner, each taken for itself, are capable of offering the different sides of a
lawofbeing,whileinsuchalawtheyaresupposedtobecapableofbeing
asserted to be, of being differentiated from each other, and, in the same
way, neither of them is supposed to be able to be mentioned instead of
theother.Norisitthecasethatifoneofthemisplacedononeside,does

to have them as processes running through everything, but not as giving

156 278. This is the way that the representational thought of a law in the
organic goes wrong. The law wants to grasp and express the opposition
as motionless aspects and to grasp and express in themselves the determi-
nateness which is their relation to each other. The inner, to which that
phenomenaluniversalitybelongs,andtheouter,towhichthepartsofthe
C.(AA)Reason 163
motionless shape belong, were supposed to constitute the corresponding
sidesofthelaw,butinbeingkeptapartinthatway,theylosetheirorganic
significance. What precisely lies at the basis of the representation of law
is that its two aspects should have a stable existence on their own part,39
where each is indifferent to the other, and the relation in them would be
portionedoutasadualdeterminatenesscommensuratewithitself.Thisis
instead what each aspect of the organic is in its own self. It is simple uni-
versalityinwhichalldeterminationshavebeendissolvedandwhichisthe

279. Looking into the difference between this legislation and previous
forms will completely clear up its nature. – Specifically, if we look back

unifiestheabsolutenegationofbeingwithmotionlessbeing,andbecause
the moments are essentially pure transition, it turns out that there are no

this advantage over determination by means of force: The latter expresses

is just irritability – and determination by means of irritability also has an
advantage to that of determination as strong muscles, an advantage which,
as in the case of force, already has within itself at the same time a reflec-
tiveturnintoitself.Likewise,weakness,orlesserforce,organicpassivity,is
determinately expressed through sensibility. However, if this sensibility is

strength, andweakness is excised in this way, still there now emerges the
equally empty and indeterminate meandering around within the oppo-
sitions of a higher and lower sensibility and within irritabilities in their
increaseanddecreaserelativetooneanother.Thephenomenaofstrength
and weakness areentirely sensuous, thoughtless determinations no less so
than are the phenomena of greater or lesser sensibility, as well as those
of greater or lesser irritability, unthinkingly grasped and just as unthink-
ingly expressed as sensuous phenomena. The concept has not taken the
placeofthoseconceptlessexpressions.Instead,strengthandweaknesshave
beenfilledoutbyadeterminatenesswhich,takensolelyforitself,restson
the concept, and although it has the concept for its content, it entirely
loses this origin and character. – Therefore, through the form of simplic-
ity and immediacy in which this content is made into an aspect of a law,
and through magnitude which constitutes the element of difference for
such determinations, the essence, which originally, as the concept, is and
is posited as the concept, retains the mode of sensuous perception, and it

Rather, the comparison that was here sought between the inner and the
outerisnowinsteadtransferredtoinorganicnature.Theinfiniteconcept

288. In the first place, that inner of the shape as the simple singularity
of an inorganic thing is specific gravity. As a simple being, specific gravity

innumerablerangeofotherpropertieswouldtogetherconstitutetheouter
aspect and would have to give expression to the determinateness of the
inner,ornumber,sothattheoneshouldfinditscounterpartintheother.
289. Now because negativity is here taken not as a movement of the
process, but as unity brought to rest, or as simple being-for-itself, it appears
161 instead as that through which the thing resists the process and through
whichitmaintainsitselfwithinitselfasindifferentwithregardtothepro-

Thisnon-essentialdifference,magnitude,thushadtohaveitscounterpart,
or its other, in the other aspect, or the plurality of properties, as it is only
as a result that it is difference at all. However much this plurality itself is
gathered up into the simplicity of opposition, and is determined, say, as
cohesion, such that this cohesion is being-for-itself in otherness in the way

process is only the determinate conduct by which its specific gravity, just
like its being-for-itself, sublates itself. This determinate conduct in which

Howevermuchthatkindofconductweretobeentirelyignored,andhow-

this determination could perhaps be thought of in this way: The greater
specific weight, as a higher inwardly-turned-being, would resist entering
into the process more than would a less specific weight. Yet conversely,
C.(AA)Reason 169
thefreedomofbeing-for-itselfpreservesitselfonlyintheeasewithwhich
it lets itself get involved with everything and maintains itself within this
diversity. That intensity without the extension of relations is a vacuous
abstraction, for extension constitutes the existence of intensity. However,
theself-conservationoftheinorganicinitsrelationfalls,asnoted,outside
the bounds of its nature, since it does not contain the principle of move-
ment in its own self, or since its being is not absolute negativity and the
concept.

not express a relation and a transition of these properties to each other

to exhibit the abolition of lawfulness, for it is the expression of determi-

meaning of this number is instead that of the indifference and freedom

something living, itself likewise proves itself to be free-standing from this
differenceofmagnitude.Asithasbeendetermined,trueuniversalityishere
only inner essence; as determinateness of the species, it is formal universal-

been shaped, reason is only as life, full stop. However, life as such in its

this belongs to speculative philosophy, in which those laws prove them-

301. This negative unity of thinking is for itself, or it is instead being-
for-itself,theprincipleofindividuality,andwithinitsrealityitisanactive
consciousness. Observing consciousness will thus by the very nature of the
matter which is at issue57 be guided towards it according to its being the
reality of those laws. While the way this all hangs together is not some-

the latter it conducts itself negatively towards itself as universal being. –
According to the first aspect, self-sufficiency gives to that which is only

303. Observational psychology, which at first expresses its perceptions

305. The moments constituting the content of the law are, on the one
hand, individuality itself, and on the other hand, its universal inorganic
nature, namely, its circumstances, situations, habits, mores, religion, and

Circumstances, situations, mores, and the like, which on the one hand
show themselves to be present and on the other hand show themselves to

be no more than empty opinionating.70 Since this alleged knowing takes
it upon itself to deal with the actuality of spirit, it also has as its object
precisely the following. Spirit is reflected out of sensuous existence back
into itself. For spirit, determinate existence is an indifferent contingency,
and so it must immediately know that in the laws which it has stumbled
upon, nothing has thereby really been said. Rather, it must immediately
know that these laws are in fact just pure chatter, or they only amount
to saying what is on one’s mind.71 It is an expression that is true in that it
expresses just that – it states one’s view72 and does thereby say anything
about the thing itself; it only adds that it is one’s own view.73 However,
according to their content, such observations cannot differ from these: “It
always rains at our annual fair,” says the retailer, and “It also rains every
time,”saysthehousewife,“whenIputmywashingouttodry.”
322. Lichtenberg, who characterizes physiognomic observation in this
way,addsthisremark:“Ifsomeonesaid,‘Tobesure,youactlikeanhonest

andareaknaveatheart,’thenanyuprightfellow,whenaddressedinthat
fashion, will, until the end of time, respond with a slap in the accuser’s

up to this point itself constitutes the content and object of observation.
Itshowsthatinitsfirstmode,namely,theobservationoftherelationships

and as simple concepts which are supposed to be kept firmly tied to the
existence of things. However, this latter point breaks down so that the
moment proves itself to be a pure movement and a universal. This free
movement,completewithinitself,retainsthemeaningthatitissomething

namely, to be there as a universal. Rather, it remains an outer, or, what is
the same thing, an inner of organic nature. – The organic process is only
free in itself but not for-itself. It is in thepurpose that the being-for-itself

content of these laws are only moments, these laws blend together in the
One of self-consciousness. – This new object, likewise taken as existent,
is singular, contingent self-consciousness. Observation thus stands both

B. TheActualizationofRationalSelf-ConsciousnessThroughItself
347. Self-consciousness found the thing as itself and itself as a thing; i.e., 193
itisforself-consciousnessthatitisinitselfobjectiveactuality.Itisnolonger
the immediate certainty of being all reality. Rather, it is the kind of cer-
tainty for which the immediate has the form of what has been sublated,
so that the certainty’s objectivity still only counts as superficial, where
the certainty’s innerness and essence is self-consciousness itself. – Hence
the object to which self-consciousness positively relates itself is self-
consciousness. The object is in the form of thinghood, i.e., it is self-
sufficient. However, self-consciousness has the certainty that for it this
self-sufficient object is nothing alien. It thereby knows that it is in itself
recognizedbytheobject.Self-consciousnessisspiritthathasthecertainty
ofhavingitsunitywithitselfinthedoublingofitsself-consciousnessand
99 fürsich. 100 unvernünftig.
204 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
in the self-sufficiency of both self-consciousnesses. To self-consciousness,
this certainty must now be elevated to truth. To self-consciousness, what
counts,thatitistobeinitself andwithinitsinnercertainty,issupposedto
enterintoitsconsciousnessandcometobeforit.
348.Whattheuniversalstationsofthisactualizationwillbe,ingeneral
have already been indicated through the comparison with the preceding
paths.Justasobservingreasonrepeatedwithintheelementsofthecategory
themovementofconsciousness(namely,sensuous-certainty,perceiving,and
understanding),reasonwillalsoagainpassthroughthedoubledmovement
of self-consciousness, and then from self-sufficiency it will make its transi-
tion into its freedom. At first, this active reason is aware of itself only as
anindividual,andassuchanindividual,itmustdemandandengenderits
actuality in an other. – Thereupon, however, while its consciousness ele-
vatesitselfintouniversality,itbecomesuniversalreasonandisconsciously
awareofitselfbothasreason,orawareofitselfasalreadyrecognizedinand
foritself,whichinitspureconsciousnessunitesallself-consciousnesses.It
isthesimplespiritualessencewhich,asitbecomescleartoitselfatthesame
time, is the real substance into which the earlier forms return as returning
into their ground, such that vis-à-vis this ground, these earlier forms are
only singular moments of its coming to be. They are moments which do
indeedtearthemselveslooseandwhichappearasshapesontheirown,but
whichinfactonlyhaveexistenceandactualitywhentheyaresupportedby
thatground,andonlyhavetheirtruthinsofarastheyareandremainwithin
itsbounds.
194 349. If we start with this aim, which is the concept that has already
emerged for us in its reality – namely, the recognized self-consciousness
which has the certainty of itself in another free self-consciousness and
whichlikewisefindsitstruthinthatfreeself-consciousness–or,ifwesin-
gleoutthisstillinnerspiritasthesubstance whichhasalreadyvigorously
grown into its existence, then within this concept, the realm of ethical life
opens itself up. For ethical life is nothing but the absolute spiritual unity
of the essence of those individuals in their self-sufficient actuality. It is in
itself a universal self-consciousness, which, to itself, is actual in another
consciousness in such a way that this other consciousness has complete
self-sufficiency, or is a thing for it, and it is just therein conscious of the
unity with the other self-consciousness, and it is in this unity with this
objective essence that it is first self-consciousness. In the abstraction of
universality, this ethical substance is only the law as it has been thought;
however,itisequallyasmuchimmediateactualself-consciousness,oritisan

ethos.101 Conversely, the singular consciousness is only this existing One,
whileitisconsciousoftheuniversalconsciousnessinitsownsingularityas
itsbeing,andwhileitsdoingandexistenceistheuniversalethos.
350. In the life of a people, the concept of the actualization of self-
conscious reason has in fact its consummate reality, namely, where in the
self-sufficiencyoftheother,eachintuitsitscompleteunitywiththeother,
or where I have for an object this freethinghood of an other, which is the
negative of myself and which I simply find before me, as my being-for-
myself.Reasonispresentasthefluiduniversalsubstance,astheunchange-
able simple thinghood which shatters into many completely self-sufficient
beings102 in the way that light likewise shatters into stars as innumerable
luminous points, each shining by its own light, which in their absolute
being-for-itself have not only in themselves been dissolved in the simple
self-sufficient substance but have also been dissolved for-themselves in it.
They are conscious of themselves as being these singular self-sufficient
beings103 as a result of their having sacrificed their singular individuality
and as a result of this universal substance being their soul and essence. In
thesamewaythisuniversalisagaintheirdoingassingularindividuals,or
itistheworkwhichisbroughtforthbythemselves.
351.Theindividual’spurelysingulargoings-on104arerelatedtotheneeds

individuality. That even these, its commonest functions, do not come to
griefbutratherhaveactuality,comesaboutthroughtheuniversalsustain-
ingmedium,throughthepowerofthewholepeople.–However,notonly
does it have this form of stable existence for its doing as such; it has its
content equally as much within the universal substance. What the indi-
vidual does is the universal skillfulness and ethos of all. In his actuality,
he is entangled with the doings of all insofar as this content completely
isolates itself. The individual’s labor for his needs is a satisfaction of the
needs of others as much as it is of his own needs, and the satisfaction of
hisownneedsissomethingheattainsonlythroughthelaborofothers.– 195

in the negation of itself, would not give itself its own positive meaning of
beingforitself.Thisunityofbeingforanother,orofmaking-oneself-into-
a-thing,andofbeing-for-itself,thisuniversalsubstance,speaksitsuniver-
sal language within the ethos and laws of a people. However, this existing
unchangeableessenceisnothingbuttheexpressionofthatsingularindivid-

withinthem,orofthemasisolatedinhisownindividualityandineachof

of himself, and each finds in existing actuality nothing but himself; he is
as certain of the others as he is of himself. – In all of them, I intuit that
forthemselves,eachisaself-sufficientbeing106 justasIamaself-sufficient
being; I intuit in them the free unity with the others so that just as this
free unity is through me, so too it is through the others themselves. It is
throughthemasMyselfandthroughMyselfasthem.
352. For that reason, in a free people reason is in truth actualized. It is
a current living spirit not only in that the individual finds his destiny,107
that is, his universal and singular essence, expressed and found present as
thinghood, but also that he himself is this essence and that he has also
achievedhisdestiny.Forthatreason,thewisestmenofantiquitymadethe
claim:Wisdomandvirtueconsistinlivinginconformitywiththeethosofone’s
people.
353. However, once self-consciousness has attained this happy
fortune,108 thatis,whereself-consciousnesshasachieveditsdestiny109 and
whereitlivessurroundedbythatdestiny,thenself-consciousness,whichis
accordingtotheconceptatfirstspiritandisspiritonlyimmediately,leavesit

vanishing magnitude which, as it comes on the scene for itself, has just
as much been immediately brought to dissolution within spirit, and it is

fixes on itself – and each moment, because it is a moment of the essence,
must arrive at the point where it exhibits itself as the essence – so has the
individual set himself over and against those laws and that ethos. Those
laws and that ethos are then only a thought without absolute essentiality,
an abstract theory without actuality. However, as this I, it is, to itself, the
livingtruth.

357. Therefore, howevermuch the truth of this rational self- 197
consciousness is for us the ethical substance, still, for it, the beginning of
its ethical experience of the world is here. From one aspect, this rational
110 fürsich.
208 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
self-consciousness has not yet become the ethical substance, this move-
ment presses onwards towards that end, and within what is sublated in
themovementarethesingularmomentswhichtoself-consciousnesswere
effectively in place111 in isolation. They have the form of an immediate
willing,oranaturaldrivewhichattainsitssatisfaction,andthissatisfaction
in turn is itself the content of a new drive. – From another aspect, this
rational self-consciousness has lost the happiness of existing within the
substance, and these natural impulses are combined with the conscious-
ness of the purposes within the natural impulses as its true destiny112
and true essentiality. Ethical substance has sunk down into a predicate
devoid of selfhood, whose living subjects are the individuals who fulfill
their universality and destiny from out of themselves. – Therefore, in the
former sense, those shapes are the coming-to-be of ethical substance, and
they precede this substance. In the latter sense, they succeed it, and, for
self-consciousness, they bring the substance which is supposed to be its
destiny to its dissolution. According to the former aspect, the immediacy
which is the very rawness of the impulses is lost in the movement in
whichthetruthofthoseimpulsesisexperienced,andtheircontentpasses
over into a higher content. However, according to the latter aspect, what
is lost is consciousness’ false representation which posits its destiny as
lying within those impulses. According to the former, the aim that they
accomplishistheimmediateethicalsubstance.Accordingtothelatter,the
aimistheconsciousnessofthesubstance,theconsciousnessthatknowsthe
substance as its own essence. Insofar as that comes about, this movement
would be the coming-to-be of morality, a higher shape than that of the
previous ethical life. Yet, at the same time, these shapes constitute only
one aspect of morality’s coming to be, namely, that which falls within
the bounds of being-for-itself, or within which consciousness sublates its
purposes. It is not the aspect according to which it comes forth from out
of the substance. Since these moments cannot yet have the meaning of
having been fashioned into purposes which stand in opposition to that
lostethicallife,heretheyarevalidjustintheirnaive,naturalcontent,and
theaimtowardswhichtheypressistheethicalsubstance.However,while
our time lies closer to the form those moments take when they appear
after consciousness has forsaken its ethical life (and when, in searching
for that ethical life, it repeats those forms), those moments may be better
represented in the expressions of those ways in which it is in search of
ethicallife.

358. Self-consciousness, which is only first the concept of spirit, enters
onto this path in the determinateness of being to itself the essence as
a singular spirit, and its purpose therefore is to give itself actualization
as a singular individual and, as such, to take pleasure in giving itself its
actualization.
359. With its destiny113 that of being, to itself, the essence as existing-
for-itself,self-consciousnessisthenegativityoftheother.Hence,initscon-
sciousness it is the positive, and as the positive, it confronts the kind of

sity.Itimmediatelyknowsthatithastheuniversal,orthe law,withinitself,

the contradiction between the law and singular individuality. On the one
hand, actuality is thus a law by which singular individuality is oppressed,
a violent order of the world which contradicts the law of the heart – and
on the other hand, it is humanity suffering under that order, a humanity
thatdoesnotfollowthelawoftheheart,butwhichisinsteadsubjectedto
an alien necessity. – This actuality, which appears in the present shape of

necessary for it. However, to itself, that moment appears as something it
just finds as given, while it has no consciousness of its origin and, to itself,
theessenceisinsteadforitself,oritisthenegativein-itselfopposedtothis
positivein-itself.
370. This necessity contradicting the law of the heart as well as the
present suffering arising out of it, are what this individuality aims at sub-
lating.Thisindividualityistherebynolongertherecklessnessoftheprevi-
203 ousshape,whichonlywantedindividualpleasure.Rather,itistheserious-
ness of a high purpose that seeks its pleasure in the exhibition of its own

it actualizes is itself the law, and its pleasure is at the same time universal
forallhearts.Bothare,toitself,inseparable;itspleasureislawful,andthe
actualization of the law of universal humanity is its own individual plea-
sure. For in its own self, individuality and necessity are immediately one;
thelawisalawoftheheart.Individualityhasnotyetbeenjiggledoutofits
place,andtheunityofbothhasneitherbeenbroughtaboutbythemedi-
ating movement of individuality nor has it yet been established through
discipline. The actualization of the immediately wicked essence counts as
exhibitingitsownexcellenceandasauthoringthewell-beingofmankind.
371. In contrast, the law which is opposed to the law of the heart is
separatedfromtheheartandisfree-standing.118 Humanity,whichbelongs
to this law, does not live in the gratifying unity of the law and the heart,
butrather,liveseitherindreadfulseparationandsuffering,oratleastinthe
deprivation of enjoying itself in obeying the law, and it lives in the defect
of the consciousness of its own excellence in the transgression of the law.
Because that divine and human order, a binding order, is separated from
the heart, it is to the heart a semblance which is supposed to forfeit what
is joined to it, namely, power and actuality. In its content, that order may
contingently coincide with the law of the heart, at which point the law
of the heart can acquiesce in it. However, it is not lawfulness purely as
such which, to the heart, is the essence but rather the consciousness of
itselfinsuchlawfulness,itsconsciousnessthatithasthereinsatisfieditself.
However,wherethecontentofuniversalnecessitydoesnotcorrespondto
theheart,then,accordingtoitscontent,universalnecessityisalsonothing

becomes a universal order, and pleasure becomes an actuality which is in

escaped the individual, and it immediately becomes only the relationship
which was supposed to be sublated. Through its actualization, the law of

instead that it is the law of another’s heart which has been accomplished.
It is according to the universal law that each is supposed to find the law
in his own heart, such that they just as much turn themselves against the
actuality which his heart established, just as he had turned against what
theirheartshadestablished.Therefore,justastheindividualinitiallyfound

sametimelearnsthisjustasaresultofactualizingthelawofitsownheart,
since this means nothing else but that individuality becomes, to itself, an

375.Therefore, for this shape of self-consciousness, what emerges from
its experience as the truth contradicts what this shape is for itself. What it
isforitselfhastheformofabsoluteuniversalityforit,anditisthelawof
the heart which is immediately one with self-consciousness. At the same
time, the stably existing and living order is just as much its own essence
and handiwork. What it originates is nothing other than what this shape
itself originates, and that shape is in an equally immediate unity with
self-consciousness.Inthisway,thisself-consciousness,whichbelongstoa

its own essence and its own actuality. What is therefore self-contradictory
in its consciousness is both in the form of essence and in the form of its
ownactualityforit.
376. While it expresses both this moment of its own self-aware down-
fall and therein the result of its experience, it shows itself to be this inner
inversionofitsself,asthemadnessofaconsciousnessforwhichitsessence

the essence, or that the non-actual is taken to be actual, so that what for
one person would be essential or actual would not be so for another, and
the consciousness of the actual and of the non-actual, or of the essential
and the inessential, would come apart. – However much something is in
factactualandessentialforconsciousnesspersebutisnotsoforme,still
I have at the same time in the consciousness of its nullity the conscious-
ness of its actuality since I too am consciousness per se – and while they
are both fixed, so is this a unity that is insanity in general. However, in
suchacondition,thereisforconsciousnessonlyanobjectwhichhasgone

of the experience which has resulted here, consciousness is, however, in
its law aware of itself as this actuality, and, at the same time, while it is,

the consciousness of virtue, the law is the essential, and individuality is to

emerged. Taken more precisely, it is again nothing but the two preceding
movements of self-consciousness. It is from them that the shape of virtue
hasemerged;whiletheyareitsorigin,virtuehasthempriortoitself.How-
ever, virtue bothsets itself tosublating its origin andto realizing itself, or
tobecomingforitself.Ontheonehand,thewayoftheworldisthussingu-
larindividualitywhichseeksitspleasureandgratification,thereinfinding
only its downfall, and as a result satisfying the universal. However, this
209 satisfaction itself, just like the rest of the moments of these relations, is
both an inverted shape and movement of the universal. Actuality is only
thesingularityofpleasureandgratification,buttheuniversalisopposedto
it. Actuality is a necessity which is only the empty shape of the universal,
onlyanegativereaction,acontent-lessdoing.–Theothermomentofthe
wayof the worldis individuality, which willstobe a law inand for itself,
and which, in this conceit, disturbs the stably existing order. To be sure,
the universal law holds its own against this sort of self-conceit, and it no
longer comes on the scene as opposed to consciousness, or as empty, as a

worldandtobringoutitstrueessence.Thistrueessenceinitiallyisinthe
way of the world only as the in-itself of the way of the world. The true
essence is not yet actual, and thus virtue only has faith in it. Virtue pro-

but the aspect of individuality. The good was supposed to be what is in
itself,tobeopposedtowhatis,butthein-itself,takenaccordingtoitsreal-

of essence in relation to actuality. However, the abstraction is just what is

theswellingisonlyduetoself-importantpuffery.–Ancientvirtuehadits
own determinate, secure meaning since it had its basis, itself rich in con-
tent, in thesubstance of the people, and it had an actual, already existing
good for its purpose. Hence, it was also oriented neither against actuality
as a universal invertedness nor against the way of the world. However, the
virtue which has been just considered has left that substance behind, and
itisavirtuewithnoessence,avirtueonlyofideasandwordswhichhave 213
dispensed with that content. The emptiness of these oratorical flourishes
in their struggle with the way of the world would be revealed at once if
what its oratory really means were simply to be stated. – It is therefore
presupposed that what these oratorical flourishes mean is well known. The
demand to put this familiarity into words would either be fulfilled by a
new torrent of fancy oratory, or by an appeal to the heart, which internal

vided unity with the universal, the being-for-itself of the way of the world
likewise proves to be nothing more than just a point of view, just like the
in-itselfofvirtueisitselfonlyapointofview.Theindividualityoftheway

C. Individuality,Which,toItself,isRealinandforItself
394. Self-consciousness has now grasped the concept of itself, which was
initiallyonlyourconceptofit,namely,thatinitscertaintyofitself,itisall
reality, and its purpose and essence henceforth consist in the self-moving
permeation of the universal – of its gifts and abilities – and individual-
ity. The singular moments of this fulfillment and permeation, priorto the
unity into which they have come together, are the purposes which have

396. Consciousness has thereby cast aside all opposition and all the
conditions for its doing. It begins anew from itself, not by directing itself
towardsanotherbutbydirectingitselftowardsitself.Whileindividualityis
actuality in its own self, the material for having an effect and the purpose
of the doing lies in the doing itself. The doing thus has the appearance

218 thus is not to let itself be led astray by the semblance of the present actu-
ality,and,fromaimlesslyrovingaboutinemptythoughtsandpurposes,it
just as much has to bind itself to the original content of its essence. – To

natures seems to come on the scene. The work, like the original nature

freed from the doing, is as a quality in the work. However, consciousness
determines itselfoverandagainsttheworkaswhathasinitdeterminate-
ness as negativity, full stop, or as doing. Consciousness is thus the univer-
sal confronting the work’s determinateness; it can therefore compare one
kind of work with another, and, from that, can grasp individuality itself
as different individualities. It can grasp the individual who, in his work, is
morecomprehensive,eitherasbeingastrongerenergyofwillorasaricher
nature, i.e., a nature whose original determinateness is less restricted – in

404. This is the concept that consciousness, which is certain of its
concept as the absolute permeation of individuality and being, makes
of itself. Let us see whether this concept is confirmed by its experience
and whether its reality thereby corresponds to it. The work is the reality

405. To consciousness, in its work the opposition of being and doing
emerges, an opposition which in the earlier shapes of consciousness was
at once the beginning of action but which is here only a result. However,
that opposition has in fact likewise been established as the basis by con-
sciousnessasindividualitysettingitselftoactionasrealinitself.Thisisso

therebynotequaltothedeterminatenessoftheoriginalnature.Here,asis
usual, it is a matter of indifference which of the two is called concept and
which is called reality. The original nature is what has been thought, or it

407. However much now, to consciousness in its work, what comes to
beistheoppositionbetweenwillingandachievement,betweenpurposeand
means,and,again,betweenthisinnernesstakenalltogetherandactuality
itself, which in general encompasses the contingency of its doing within
itself, still the unity and the necessity of this consciousness is also just as
present. This latter aspect overlaps with the former, and the experience of
thecontingencyofthedoingisitselfonlyacontingentexperience.Thenecessity

besure,thereturnsouttobeacontingencywhichcontrastsbeingachieved

rather it is the vanishing itself which is both actual and bound up with
the work, and it vanishes with the work. The negative, together with the
positivewhichisitsnegation,itselfperishes.
408. This vanishing of the vanishing lies in the concept of individual-
ity that is real in itself, for it isobjective actuality which is that in which
the work, or what is in the work, vanishes, and it is objective actuality
whichwassupposedtogivewhatwascalled“experience”itssupremacyover
individuality’s concept of itself. However, objective actuality is a moment
which, within this consciousness itself, also no longer has any truth for
itself. Truth consists only in the unity of the work with the doing, and
the true work is only that unity of being and doing, of willing and accom-
plishing. To consciousness, in virtue of the certainty lying at the basis 223
of its acting, the actuality opposed to this certainty is the actuality itself
that only is for consciousness. To consciousness, which as self-consciousness
has returned into itself and to which all opposition has vanished, the
opposition can no longer take this form of its being-for-itself over and
against actuality. Rather, the opposition and the negativity which come
to light in the work thereby affects more than just the content of the
work or of consciousness but rather also affects actuality as such actuality
and thereby affects the opposition present in that actuality through actu-
ality itself and thereby affects the work’s vanishing. In this manner, con-

the one hand, the various moments of the original determinateness, or
what constitutes this individual’s crux of the matter, namely, his purposes,
his means, his acts and his actuality, are for this consciousness singular

411. Consciousness is called honest which on the one hand has arrived
at this idealism which the crux of the matter expresses, and on the other
hand has the truth as this formal universality in the crux of the matter.

at all, or it is just as much pure doing as it is empty purpose or perhaps an
actuality unencumbered by deeds. It makes one meaning after another into
the subject of this predicate, and then it forgets one after the other. Now

414. However, the truth of this honesty is that it is not as honest as it
seems, for it cannot be so thoughtless as to let these various moments in
fact come undone from each other in that way. Rather, it must have an
immediate consciousness of their opposition because they are so plainly
related to each other. The pure doing is essentially this individual’s doing,
andthisdoingislikewiseessentiallyanactuality,orafact.Conversely,actu-
ality essentially is only as his doing as well as a doing, full stop, and just as
his doing is at the same time only as a doing, full stop, it is also actuality.

417. There is therefore just as much deception of oneself and of others
when what is at stake is supposed be the pure fact. A consciousness that

the move and considers himself invited, and that instead of a pure doing
or a distinctive individual doing, there is something which is just as well
for others, or it isa crux of the matter which has been brought into the
open. The same happens in both cases, and it only takes on a different
sense vis-à-vis what had been thereby accepted and supposed to count as
valid.Consciousnessexperiencesbothaspectsasequallyessentialmoments,

What consciousness experiences is that no single one of these moments 228

being-for-itself of this essence, which for that very reason is the truth
because it is just as much the self of consciousness as it is the in-itself of
consciousness,orpureconsciousness.

now still have to see just what constitutes the being which is expressed

closely linked with its universal pronouncements that it is how it meant

oughttospeakthetruthaccordingtohisknowingandconviction,i.e.,it
said something other than it meant, and saying something other than one
means is what one calls “not speaking the truth.” The improved untruth,
ortheimprovedlackofadroitness,isnowexpressed:Eachoughttospeakthe
truth according to his knowing and conviction about it at the time. – How-
ever, therewith what is universally necessary, what is valid in itself, or what
thepropositionwantedtoexpressisinsteadinvertedintoacompletecon-
tingency: Whether the truth will be spoken is left up to the contingency
of whether I know it and can convince myself of it; and with that there
is nothing further said, other than that it is a confused muddle of truth
andfalsitywhichoughttobesaidandrelativetowhatoneknows,intends,
and comprehends. This contingency of content has universality only in the
form of the proposition in which it is expressed; but as an ethical proposi-
tion,itpromisesauniversalandnecessarycontent,anditthuscontradicts
itself through the contingency of its content. – Finally, if the proposition
were to be improved so that the contingency of knowing and conviction
of the truth were to be dropped, and if it were that the truth is supposed
tobeknown,thenitwouldbeacommandthatcompletelycontradictsits
startingpoint.Healthyrationalitywasatfirstsupposedtohavetheability
to express the truth immediately; however, now what is being said is that
it ought to know the truth, i.e., that it does not immediately know how to

424. Another famous command is: Love thy neighbor as thyself. It is
directed to a singular individual in a relationship with another singular
individual, and it asserts it as a relationship between a singular individual
and a singular individual, or as a relationship of sentiment. Active love – 231
for an inactive love has no being and is for that reason surely not what is
meant here – aims at removing an evil from someone and adding some
good to him. To this end, the difference must be drawn between what is

428. A difference in the simple ethical substance is a contingency for that
substance,acontingencywhichwesawariseindeterminatecommandsas
the contingency of knowing, actuality, and acts. The comparison of that
simple being with its determinateness, which in turn did not correspond
tothatsimplebeing,wasmadebyus.Thesimplesubstancethereinshowed
itself to be formal universality, or to be pure consciousness which, free-
standingvis-à-visthecontent,confrontsitandisaknowingofitasdeter-
minate content. In this manner, this universality remains the same as the
crux of the matter was. However, within consciousness this universality is
an other; it no longer is the inert, utterly unthinking genus but is related
to the particular and counts as its power and truth. – This consciousness
initially seems to be the same testing which was formerly what we were
doing, and its doing seems incapable of being anything else than what
has already taken place, a comparison of the universal with the determi-
nate,fromwhichtheirinadequacy[toeachother],justasitdidpreviously,
results. However, the relationship of content to universal is here some-
thingdifferentbecausethisuniversalhasobtainedadifferentsignificance.
Itisformaluniversality,somethingwithwhichthedeterminatecontentis

the comparison has vanished; the universal is no longer the existing sub-
stance validly in force, or the right in and for itself, but is rather simple
knowing or form which compares a content only with itself and which
looks at it in order to see whether it is a tautology. Laws are no longer
given laws but are tested, and for the consciousness that is doing the test-

429.However,forthatveryreasonthistestingdoesnotgetveryfar.Just
because the criterion is a tautology and is indifferent with regard to the

does its opposite. – Take the question: Ought it be a law in and for itself
that there should be property? In and for itself, not because of utility for

However, a concern for need sototallyin accordancewithcontingency is

contradictory to the nature of the conscious beings about which we are
speakinghere,forsuchabeingmustrepresenthisneedintheformofuni-
versality, must be concerned for his whole existence, and he must acquire
for himself a lasting good. The thought that a thing is contingently to be
awarded to the first self-conscious living creature according to his needs
is thus not in agreement with itself. – If in a community of commonly

is only for the reason that it has not been left as a simple determinate-

standardofthelawwhichreasonhasinitsownselfthereforefitseverycase
equally well and is thus in fact no criterion at all. – It would also be very
peculiar if tautology, the principle of non-contradiction, which everyone
concedes to be only a formal criterion for knowing of theoretical truth,
i.e.,assomethingwhichissupposedtobewhollyindifferenttotruthand
untruth, were for the knowing of practical truth supposed to be more than
that.

essence, there were the positing of immediate determinatenesses in ethi-
cal substance and then the knowing of whether those determinatenesses
are laws; both of them have now been sublated. What seems to be the
result is that neither determinate laws nor a knowing of these determi-
nate laws is able to transpire. Yet substance is the consciousness of itself as
absoluteessentiality,aconsciousnesswhichcanthereforeneitherrelinquish

Thatbothlaw-givingandlaw-testinghaveshownthemselvestobenulland

category which is immediately actuality, and the world is only this actu-
ality. However, while this existing law is unreservedly valid and in force,
the obedience given by self-consciousness is not that of service rendered
to a master, whose orders would be only arbitrary and in which it would
notrecognize172itself.Rather,thelawsarethethoughtsofitsownabsolute

436. The difference between self-consciousness and the essence is thus
completely transparent. As a result, the differences in the essence itself are
236 not contingent determinatenesses, but, on account of the unity of the
essenceandself-consciousnessfromwhichalonesuchaninequalitycould

thispureunityoftheIandofbeing,ofbeing-for-itself andbeing-in-itself,

of this immediate instinct for finding, the sublation of this unconscious
existence of the truth. The intuited category, thefound thing, enters con-
sciousness as the being-for-itself of the I, which now knows itself in the
objective essence as the self. However, this determination of the category,
as being for-itself opposed to being-in-itself, is just as one-sided and is a
self-sublatingmoment.Consequently,thecategoryisdeterminedforcon-

254 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
which spirit confronts, or rather which confronts itself as an objective
actual world, a world which has, for the self, just as much lost all sig-
239 nificance as something alien, just as the self has lost all sense of being
a dependent or independent being-for-itself separated from that world.
Spirit is the substance and the universal self-equal, lasting essence1 – it is
the unshakable and undissolved ground and point of origin for the doing
ofeachandall–itistheirpurposeandgoalastheconceptualized2 in-itself

work, which as a result engenders itself through the doing of each and all
astheirunityandequality,forthissubstanceisbeing-for-itself,ortheself,

However, as being-for-itself, it is the dissolved essence, the self-sacrificing,

439. Spirit is thereby the self-supporting, absolute, real essence. All the
previous shapes of consciousness are abstractions from it. They are this,
that spirit analyzes itself, differentiates its moments, and lingers with the
individual.4 Isolating such moments has spirit itself as its presupposition
and its stable existence, or the isolating only exists in the spirit which is
existence.5 Isolated in this way, these moments seem as if that isolation
is what they were. However, just as they are only moments or vanishing
magnitudes, is shown by their advance and retreat into their ground and
essence, and this essence just is this movement and dissolution of these
moments.Here,wherespiritorthereflectionofspiritintoitselfisposited,

spirit holds fast to the moment that, to itself, it, spirit, is objective, exis-

for-itself. If on the contrary it holds fast to the other moment of the
analysis, that its object is its being-for-itself, then it is self-consciousness.

However, as immediate consciousness of being-in-and-for-itself, as the
unity of consciousness and self-consciousness, it is consciousness which
has reason, which, as the “having” denotes, has the object as rationally
determined in-itself, or by the value of the category, but so that for the
consciousness of the object, the object does not yet have the value of the
category.Spirithereistheconsciousnessoutofwhoseexaminationwejust

the reason that is, or as the reason that is actual in spirit and which is
spirit’s world, then spirit is in its truth. It is spirit, it is the actual ethical
essence.

and for the latter, which is purified, substantial consciousness, the plural-
ity of ethical moments condenses itself instead into the twofoldness of a
law of singular individuality and a law of universality. However, each of
these social estates of substance remains the whole spirit. If the things in
sense-perception have no substance other than the two determinations of 242
singularity and universality, here they only express the superficial opposi-
tionofbothaspectstoeachother.
446. In the essence we are here considering, the meaning of singular
individuality is that of self-consciousness in general, not that of a singular,
contingent consciousness. In this determination, the ethical substance is
thustheactualsubstance,absolutespiritrealizedinthepluralityofdeter-

entered into the practical shaping of reason itself, was for us the absolute
essence and which here emerges in its truth for itself as a conscious eth-
ical essence and as the essence for the consciousness which we now have as
our object. It is spirit which is for itself, while it sustains itself within the
counter-glow12 of the individuals – and which is in itself, or is substance
while it sustains the individuals within itself. As the actual substance, it is
a people, and as actual consciousness, it is the citizens of the nation.13 This

of assistance or service to be rendered. The content of the ethical action
must be substantial, or, whole and universal. Hence, the action can only

this must also not be so understood that it would be represented as doing

who, out of the long progression of his dispersed existence, is condensed
into one completed shape and who has been elevated out of the unrest of

something non-rational. It is to make it so that it too may be something
done, and that the right of consciousness would be asserted within that

ness and universality of a self-aware essence does not in truth belong to

summation and the highest work that the individual as such undertakes
for the polity. However, insofar as he is essentially singularly individual,
it is contingent as to whether his death was both immediately connected
with and was the result of his work for the universal. This is so in part
becauseifitwas,thenitwouldbethenaturalnegativityandmovementof

the individual’s becoming pure being, is necessary, the blood-relationship
takesuponitselfthedeedofdestruction.–Ittherebycomestopassthatthe

464.Thegroundfromwhichthismovementbothstartsandonwhich
it advances is the realm of ethical life, but this movement’s activity is
self-consciousness. As ethical consciousness, it is the simple, pure direction
towards ethical essentiality, or duty. Within it, there is neither arbitrary
choice nor is there struggle or indecision, as it has forsaken both giving
the law and testing the law. Rather, to itself, the ethical essentiality is the
immediate, the unwavering, what is free of contradiction. There is there-
fore neither the painful spectacle of a collision between passion and duty,
northecomicalspectacleofacollisionbetweendutyandduty–acollision,
whichaccordingtoitscontentisthesameasthatbetweenpassionandduty,
252 for passion is just as capable of being represented as duty. This is because
duty, like consciousness withdrawing itself back into itself from out of its
immediate essentiality, becomes a formal-universal with which, just as it
didbefore,anycontentcorrespondsequallywell.However,thecollisionof
dutiesiscomicalbecauseitexpressesthecontradictioninanabsolutewhich

known and the not known, just as in substance, there was an opposition
betweentheconsciousandtheunconscious,andtheabsoluterightofethical 253
self-consciousnesscomesintoconflictwiththedivinerightofessence.Forself-
consciousness as consciousness, objective actuality as such objective actu-
ality has essentiality, but according to its substance, self-consciousness is
the unity of itself and this opposite, and ethical self-consciousness is the
consciousnessofsubstance.Forthatreason,theobjectasopposedtoself-

473. However much the universal so easily pushes off the pure tip of
its pyramid and is victorious over the rebellious principle of singular indi-
viduality, or the family, still it has as a result committed itself to a strug-

actualization, so too will this self-sufficiency repeat stoicism’s movement.
Stoicism passes over into the skeptical disorientation of consciousness,
into a kind of blather about the negative, which in shapelessly drifting
262 from one contingency of being and thought to another, certainly brings
them to dissolution within its absolute self-sufficiency, but then likewise
creates them anew. It is in fact only the contradiction between the self-

validityofself-consciousnessistherealityalienatedfromit.Thisvalidityis 264
the universal actuality of the self, but this actuality is immediately just as
much an inversion. It is the loss of its essence. – The actuality of the self
whichwasnotpresentintheethicalworldhasbeenattainedbyitsreturn
into the person, and what was unified in the ethical world now comes on
thesceneasbothdevelopedandasalienatedfromitself.
B. SpiritAlienatedfromItself:CulturalFormation
483. The ethical substance kept the opposition enclosed within its sim-
ple consciousness, and it kept this consciousness in an immediate unity
withitsessence.Forthatreason,theessenceforconsciousnesshasthesim-
pledeterminatenessofbeing,towardswhichconsciousnessisimmediately
directed and whose ethos it is. Consciousness neither counts to itself as
this exclusionary self, nor does the substance signify an existence excluded
fromit,withwhichconsciousnesswouldhavepositeditselfasoneonlyby
alienating itself from that substance and engendering it at the same time.

oritisthespiritualpowersbringingthemselvesintoorderinaworldand
asaresultsustainingthemselves.
484. It is in this manner that substance is spirit, or the self-conscious
unity of the self and essence. However, for each other, what each of
them means is also alienation from the other. Spirit is consciousness of an
objective actuality freely existing on its own,50 but confronting this latter
consciousness is the former unity of the self with essence, or actual con-
sciousness confronting pure consciousness. On the one hand, through
its self-relinquishing, actual self-consciousness makes a transition into
the actual world, which then passes over again back into actual self-
consciousness. But on the other hand, this actuality, as well as the person
andobjectivity,areallsublated;theyarepurelyuniversal.Theiralienation
is pure consciousness, or theessence . The present moment immediately has
its opposite in its other-worldly beyond, which is its thinking and having
beenthought,justasthisother-worldlybeyondhasitsoppositeinthethis-
worldly,whichisitsactualityalienatedfromit.
485. This spirit therefore develops not only a world, it also develops a
doubled world, which is divided and opposed within itself. – The world
of ethical spirit is its own present time, and hence every power within it is
in this unity, and insofar as each differentiates itself from the other, each
is in equilibrium with the whole. Nothing signifies the negative of self-
consciousness; even the departed spirit is present in the blood of his rela-
tives, current in the self of the family, and the universal power of govern-
mentisthewill,theselfofthepeople.However,here,[atthisstageofthe
exposition,] “the currently present” only means objective actuality, which
has its consciousness in the other-worldly beyond. As essence, each singu-

ThisEnlightenmentalsobringsalienationtoitsculminationinthisrealm

of being both self-equal and motionless. The Enlightenment throws the
housekeeping of faith into disarray by bringing in the utensils belonging
to the world of the here-and-now, a world which faith cannot deny is its
property while its consciousness just as much belongs to that world. – In

It thereby becomes the spirit of this authority and becomes an unlimited
monarch.73 – Unlimited: The language of flattery elevates this authority
into its purified universality; the moment, as language’s creation, as exis-

guage of flattery just as much elevates singular individuality to its peak;
according to this aspect of simple spiritual unity, the noble consciousness

which, on the one hand, comes about in its retaining its own will in its

by itself alienating its own inner and thus becoming the highest pitch of
inequality with itself, and in part by subjugating the universal substance
to itself so that it makes that substance thoroughly unequal to itself. – It
becomes clear that, as a result, its determinateness, which it had in judg-
ments contra to what was called the base consciousness, has thereby also
vanished.Thebaseconsciousnesshasachieveditsend,thatofsubordinat-

In that way, it preserves its own spirit in its own self. – Since the form of
this movement has been analyzed earlier, here it suffices to determine its
content.
515. The noble consciousness thus relates itself here not to the object
as essence. Rather, what is alien, to itself, is here being-for-itself. Itfinds
that its own self as such a self is alienated, and it finds it as an objective,
fixed actuality which it has to receive from another fixed being-for-itself.
Its object is being-for-itself and thus its own; but as a result of its being
anobject,itisatthesametimeimmediatelyanalienactualitywhichisits

516. Self-consciousness can abstract from every singular aspect, and for
that reason, it retains its recognition77 and validity-in-itself as the essence
existing for itself even in an obligation which concerns only one of those
aspects.However,hereitseesitselffromthesideofitsownmostpureactu-

it sees its personality as such dependent on the contingent personality of

ThepureIitselfhasbeenabsolutelysubverted.
517. However much this consciousness thus gets back from wealth the
objectivity of its being-for-itself and sublates that objectivity, still accord-
281 ing to its concept, it is not only not perfected in the way in which the
preceding reflection was perfected, it is also for its own part unsatisfied.
The reflection in which the self receives itself as something objective is
the immediate contradiction posited as lying in the pure I itself. But as
theself,thisconsciousnessimmediatelystandsabovethiscontradiction;it
is the absolute elasticity which again sublates the self’s sublation and dis-

518.Therefore,whilethecircumstancesofthisconsciousnessarebound
up with this absolute disruption, the difference within its spirit, which is
a difference determined as the opposition between the noble conscious-
ness and the base consciousness, itself falls by the wayside, and both are
the same. – The spirit of beneficent wealth can be further distinguished

this pure disruption, in which, while, to itself, the self-equality of being-

522. If we take the speech of this disorientation, which is so clear to
itself, and contrast it with the speech of that simple consciousness of the
trueandthegood,wefindthatthelatter,whenconfrontingthefrankand
self-aware eloquence of the culturally formed and educated spirit,82 can
only speak in monosyllables, for it can say nothing to that spirit which
the culturally formed and educated spirit does not itself know and say. If

288 ity itself, and it is the opposition to the actuality of self-consciousness in
particular.Itisthusessentiallyonlyafaith.

of actuality. However, while it is only the flight away from this actuality
and is, as a result, the determinateness of opposition, it has in its own self
thisdeterminatenessofopposition.Thus,pureconsciousnessisinitsown
self essentially self-alienated, and faith constitutes only one aspect of it.
To us, the other aspect has already emerged. Specifically, pure conscious-
ness is the reflection out of the world of cultural formation so that both

stepoutsideofself-consciousness,stillthelatterdoeslikewisehaveitscon-
tent within the element of pure self-consciousness. However, it has it in
thinking,notinconcepts,inpureconsciousness,notinpureself-consciousness.
Faith is thereby indeed pure consciousness of the essence, which is to say,
of simple inwardness, andis therefore thinking – the chief moment in the
nature of faith, which is usually overlooked. The immediacy with which
the essence lies within faith has to do with its object being essence, which
is to say, pure thinking. However, insofar as thinking enters consciousness,
orinsofaraspureconsciousnessentersintoself-consciousness,thisimme-

of pure thinking into consciousness has the opposite determination. The
meaningofobjectivityisthatitisanonlynegativecontent,thatitsublates

object,or,theobjectonlyhastruthinsofarasithastheformoftheself.

of them, each is in and for itself, external to all relationships. According
to another, each relates itself to the actual world that is opposed to pure
consciousness.Accordingtothethirdaspect,eachrelatesitselftotheother
fromwithinpureconsciousness.
530. The aspect of being-in-and-for-itself within the faithful conscious-
ness is its absolute object, or the object whose content and determina-
tion have according to the concept of faith already resulted. This is so
because the object is itself nothing but the real world elevated into the
universality of pure consciousness. The articulation of the latter, the real
world, thus constitutes the organization of the world of faith, except that

of their form. Just as in the world of cultural formation, state-power or

533.Accordingtothissecondrelationship,thefaithfulconsciousnessin
parthasitsactualityintherealworldofculturalformation,anditconsti-
tutes what has already been considered, that world’s spirit and existence.
However, in part faith confronts its own actuality as being that of vanity
itself, and it is the movement of sublating that actuality. This movement
does not consist in its supposedly having a spirited, witty consciousness
aboutitsowninvertedness,foritisthesimpleconsciousnessthatreckons
wittobevanitybecausewitstillhastherealworldforitspurpose.Rather,
confronting the motionless realm of its thinking is actuality as a spiritless
existence, which consequently is to be overcome in an external manner.
Through the sublation of both doing and sensuous knowing, this obe-
dience of service and praise brings forth the consciousness of unity with
the essence existing in and for itself, although not as an intuited, actual
unity.Rather,thisserviceisonlythatincessantengendering[oftheunity],

534. However, in pure insight the concept alone is the actual, and this

whether it is what is existing-in-itself, and it proceeds to make them into
concepts.Pureinsightisnotonlythecertaintyofself-consciousreasonthat
itisalltruth;rather,itknowsthatitisalltruth.
536. However, as the concept of pure insight comes on the scene, it is
not yet realized. Its consciousness of the concept accordingly appears as
something still contingent and singularly individual, and what to it is the
essence appears as a purpose which it is to realize. This consciousness first

II. TheEnlightenment
537. The distinctive object against which pure insight aims the force of
the concept is faith, which is understood as the form of pure conscious-
nesswhichconfrontspureinsightwithinthesameelement.However,pure
insight also has a relation to the actual world, for, like faith, it is a return
into pure consciousness from the actual world. To start with, it remains
to be seen just how its activity is constituted with respect to the impure
intentionsandtheinvertedinsightsofthatworld.
538. Mention was made above of the motionless consciousness which
confronts this self-dissolving and self-recreating vortex; it constitutes the
aspect of pure insight and intention. However, as we saw, no particular
insight about the sphere of cultural formation falls within this motionless
consciousness;instead,itisthelatteritselfwhichhasthemostpainfulfeel-

every bone in its body, has been broken on the wheel. Likewise, it is the
language of this feeling and its spirited, witty speech pronouncing judg-

none of its own activity and content and thus can only carry on as the
formal,loyalcomprehensionofitsownwittyinsightintotheworldandits

541. The various modes of the negative conduct of consciousness, which
areinpartthoseofskepticismandinpartthoseoftheoreticalandpractical
idealism, are subordinate shapes with respect to those of pure insight and
ofitsdiffusion,theEnlightenment.Thisissobecausepureinsightisborn
from the substance, and it both knows the pure self of consciousness as
absolute, and it incorporates that self into the pure consciousness of the
absolute essence of all actuality. – While faith and insight are the same
pure consciousness but are opposed according to their form, the essence
forfaithisthoughtbutnotthoughtasconcept,andthussomethingutterly

542. It knows faith to be opposed to itself and thus opposed to reason
and truth. Just as, to the Enlightenment, faith is on the whole a tissue of

insight,astheuniversalsocialestateofconsciousness,isimmediate,naive,
and completely lacking in any reflective turn into itself.91 However, the

individuality, which isolates itself from the universal naive consciousness,
is its opposite and it cannot immediately come into contact with it. The
will of the deceiving priesthood and the oppressive despot is thus not the
immediate object of its doing, but rather, its object is insight without a
will,theinsightwhichisnotthinningitselfoutintobeing-for-itself,orthe
concept of rational self-consciousness which has its existence in the social
estatesbutwhichisnotyetpresentwithinthemastheconcept.However,
while pure insight rescues this honest insight and its naive essence from
prejudices and errors, it wrests from the hands of bad intentions the real-
ity and its power of its deceit, whose realm has its basis and material in
theconceptlessconsciousnessoftheuniversalsocialestates–thebeing-for-
itself [oftheuniversalsocialestate]hasitssubstanceinsimpleconsciousness,
fullstop.
544.Therelationofpureinsighttothenaiveconsciousnessofabsolute
essence now has two sides. On the one hand, pure insight is in itself one 295
and the same as the naive consciousness, but on the other hand, this

naiveconsciousnesswithinthesimpleelementofitsthoughtletstheabso-
lute essence, as well as its parts, go their own way. It allows them to give
themselves stable existence, and for that reason, it allows them to count
only as its in-itself and to be in an objective mode, but it repudiates its
being-for-itself within this in-itself. – To the extent that for pure insight
this faith is, according to the first aspect, in itself pure self-consciousness
and is supposed to become this only for itself, pure insight has in this
concept of faith the element in which, in place of false insight, it realizes
itself.
545. From this aspect, that both are essentially the same, the relation
of pure insight happens in and through the same element. The commu-
nication between them is immediate, and their giving and receiving is an
undisturbed flow of the one into the other. Whatever other pegs may be
drivenintoconsciousness,itisinitself thissimplicityinwhicheverything

this insight has already made itself widespread, and the struggle against it
betrays the fact that the infection has already taken hold. The struggle is
too late, and all the remedies taken only make the disease worse, for the
disease has seized the very marrow of spiritual life, namely, consciousness
in its concept, or its pure essence itself. For that reason, there is no force
within it that could prevail over the disease. Because it is in the essence
itself, its still isolated expressions are repressed, and its superficial symp-
toms are muffled. This is immensely to its advantage, for in that case it

546. However, this mute weaving of spirit in the simple inwardness of
its substance conceals to itself what it is doing and is only one side of the
realizationofpureinsight.Itsdiffusiondoesnotonlyconsistin“likecom-
ing together with like,” and its actualization is not only extension with-
out opposition. Rather, the doing on the part of negative essence is just
as essentially a developed self-differentiating movement, which, as a con-
sciousdoing,mustsetupitsmomentswithinadeterminatelymanifested

547. It thus remains to be seen how pure insight and intention conduct

tion it becomes the negative of pure intention and grows into lies and a
dishonestyaboutitspurpose.
548. It is thereby entangled in this contradiction as a result of having
both let itself get into this quarrel and as a result of thinking of itself as
doing battle with something other. – This is what it means to do, for its
essence as absolute negativity is just its having otherness in its own self.

in the very movement of developing the moments and taking them back

However, the first aspect of this struggle is the pollution of the Enlight-

551. Let us further see how faith experiences the Enlightenment in the
differentiated moments of its consciousness. From the point of view just
noted, this was only gestured at in a very general way. However, these
moments are as follows: pure thinking, or the absolute essence, as object,
inandforitself;next,asknowing,faith’srelationtothegroundofitsfaith;
and,finally,faith’srelationtoitinitsdoings,orinitsreligiousservice.Just

This could still be taken either as the pure in-itself of thinking, or else as
thebeingofsensuous-certainty.However,whileatthesametimeitisactual
consciousness for the self, and this self as the self that has an object, so is
insight’s distinctive object as such an ordinary existing thing of sensuous-
certainty. Its object appears to it in faith’s representation of it. Pure insight
condemns this, and in doing so, it condemns its own object. It already, 300

For the Enlightenment, this ground just as much becomes a contingent
knowingofcontingentoccurrences.However,thegroundofknowingisthe
knowing universal, and in its truth it is absolute spirit, which, in abstract
pure consciousness, or in thinking as such, is only absolute essence, but
which as self-consciousness is self-knowing. Likewise, pure insight posits
thisknowinguniversal,thesimpleself-knowingspirit,asthenegativeofself-
consciousness. This pure insight is indeed itself pure mediated thinking,
or thinking mediating itself with itself. It is pure knowing, but while it
is pure insight, or pure knowing which does not yet know itself, i.e., it is
what, to itself, is not yet this pure, mediating movement, this movement
appears to pure insight, as does everything which it is itself, as an other.

561. Different things are useful to each other in different ways, but all
thingshavethisusefulreciprocitythroughtheiressence,namely,thatthey
are related to the absolute in a twofold manner – the positive way, as a
result of which they are in and for themselves, and the negative way, as a
result of which they are for others. The relation to the absolute essence, or
to religion, is thus among all utilities the most useful, for it is pure utility
itself.Itisthestableexistenceofallthings,ortheirbeing-in-and-for-itself,
andthepitfallofallthings,ortheirbeingforothers.
562. Of course, this positive result of the Enlightenment is for faith as
much a horror as is the Enlightenment’s negative conduct towards faith.
This insight into the absolute essence that sees nothing in it but the abso-
lute essence itself, the être suprême, or thevoid – thisintention that every-
thing in its immediate existence is in itself, or, is good, that finally the
relation of the singular conscious being to the absolute essence, religion,
is to be exhaustively expressed in the concept of utility is, to faith, some-
thingutterlyabhorrent.This,theEnlightenment’sownwisdom,necessarily
appears to faith at the same time as shallowness itself and as the very con-
fession of shallowness because it consists in knowing nothing of absolute
essence,or,whatamountstothesamething,inknowingonlythisentirely

564. For the Enlightenment does not conduct itself with regard to the
faithfulconsciousnessintermsofanydistinctiveprinciplesofitsown,but
rather does so with the principles which faith has in itself. The Enlight-
enment only brings together faith’s own thoughts, which, to the faithful
consciousness,comeundonewithoutitsbeingawareofit.TheEnlighten-

in the faithful consciousness itself, but only in that faith does not think
about it but has the other somewhere else. Hence, that other is neither
alientofaithnorcanitbedeniedbyfaith.
565. However, the Enlightenment itself, which reminds faith of the
oppositionwithineachofitsvariousisolatedmoments,isnomoreenlight-
enedaboutitself.Itconductsitselfpurelynegativelytowardsfaithinsofaras

(BB)Spirit 329
it itself is in the opposition of both moments, one of which, namely, the
one that is in every case opposed to faith, only bestows recognition on it, 307
separatingitself,however,fromtheotherexactlyinthewaythatfaithdoes.
TheEnlightenmentthusdoesnotbringouttheunityofbothastheunity
of both, i.e., the concept, but, to it, the concept emerges for itself, or, the
Enlightenmentencountersitonlyaspresent,forinitselfthisisjustthevery
realization of pure insight. The pure insight whose essence is the concept
initiallycomestobe,toitself,asanabsoluteother,anditdeniesitself,for
the opposite of the concept is the absolute opposite. It then comes back
round to itself, to its concept, from out of this otherness. – However, the
Enlightenmentisonlythismovement;itisthestillunconsciousactivityof
thepureconceptwhich,tobesure,comesbackroundtoitselfasobjectbut
whichtakesthisobjectforanotherandwhichisalsonotevenawareofthe

theconceptinsofarasinsightisboththemovementandtherelatingofthe

theactualityonwhichitbringsthisauthoritytobearliespreciselyinthis,
that the faithful consciousness is itself the concept, and that it thus itself
recognizesandacceptstheoppositionthatinsightbringstoit.Forthatrea-
son, insight keeps its right against faith because what it affirms in faith is
whatisnecessarytofaithitselfandwhatfaithhasinitsownself.
566. At first the Enlightenment asserts the moment of the concept to
be a doing of consciousness. What it assertsagainst faith is just this – that
faith’s absolute essence is an essence of faith’s consciousness as a self, or
thatthisabsoluteessenceissupposedtobebroughtoutthroughconscious-
ness. Its absolute essence is, to the faithful consciousness, precisely as it is
asfaith’sin-itself,atthesametimenotlikesomealienthingwhichwould

gotthere,”butrather,faith’sconfidenceconsistsonlyinfindingitselfasthis

serviceconsistinengenderingthatessenceasitsabsoluteessencethrough
faith’s own doing. In effect the Enlightenment only reminds faith of this
when faith starkly declares that the in-itself of the absolute essence is the
other-worldly beyond of the doing of consciousness. – However, while, to
besure,theEnlightenmentbringsupfaith’sone-sidednessconcerningthe

330 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
opposing moment of faith’s own doing in contrast to what is,109 which is
allthatfaiththinksabouthere,anddoesnotbringtogetheritsownoppos-
ing thoughts, the Enlightenment isolates the pure moment of doing and
declaresfaith’sin-itself tobeonlysomethingbroughtoutbyconsciousness.
However,theisolateddoingopposedtothein-itself isacontingentdoing,
and, as what representational thought does, it is an engendering of fic-
tions – representations which are not in itself, and so this is the way in
308 which the Enlightenment regards the content of faith. – But, conversely,
pureinsightstatestheveryopposite.Whileinsightaffirmsthemomentof
othernesswhichtheconcepthasinit,itexpressestheessenceoffaithasthat
which does not concern consciousness, which is an other-worldly beyond to
consciousness, something alien and unknown to it. To faith, the essence,
on the one hand, is exactly what it places its trust in and in which it has
certaintyofitself,whereas,ontheotherhand,theessenceisinscrutablein
itswaysandunattainableinitsbeing.
567. Furthermore, the Enlightenment asserts a right contra the faith-
fulconsciousnessthatfaithitselfconcedeswhentheEnlightenmenttakes
the object of the faith’s veneration to be stone and wood, or otherwise
regardsitasafinite,anthropomorphicdeterminateness.Forsinceitisthis
estranged consciousness in that it has an other-worldly realm beyond actu-

ing,forithasarelationtocontingencies,andtheabsoluteessenceitselfis
109 dasSein.
(BB)Spirit 331
for it in the form of a represented, ordinary actuality. Thus, the faithful
consciousness is also a certainty which does not have the truth in its own
self, and it avows itself to be an inessential consciousness of this kind, or
to be on the this-worldly side of the self-assuring and self-authenticating
spirit. – However, in its spiritually immediate knowing of the absolute
essence,thefaithfulconsciousnessforgetsthismoment.–ButtheEnlight-
enment,whichremindsfaithofthis,againonlythinksofcontingentknow-
ing, and it forgets the other – it only thinks of the mediation that comes
about through an alien third term, and it does not think of that within
which the immediate is, to itself, itself the third term through which it
mediatesitselfwiththeother,namely,withitself.
569.Finally,initsviewofwhatfaithdoes,theEnlightenmentfindsthat
faith’sdismissalofpossessionsandconsumptionissomethingbothwrong 309
andwithoutpurpose.110–Asfarasthatwrongisconcerned,theEnlighten-
ment is on this point in accord with the faithful consciousness itself. The
faithfulconsciousnessrecognizestheactualityofpossessingpropertyandof

togethersidebyside.Thesacrificeisonlyasignthattheactualsacrificehas
beenaccomplishedinonlyasmalldegreeandconsequentlythatitinfact

570. With regard to purposiveness, the Enlightenment finds it simply
inept either to discard a possession in order both to know and to prove
that one is liberated from possession per se or to renounce an enjoyment
in order both to know and prove that one is liberated from enjoyment.

310 572.TheEnlightenmentthereforehasanirresistibleauthorityoverfaith

momentswhichtheEnlightenmentitselfhasvalidated.Iftheeffectofthis
forceisexaminedmoreclosely,thenitscomportmentwithrespecttofaith
seemstodisruptthebeautifulunityoftrustandfaith’simmediatecertainty;
it seems to pollute its spiritual consciousness with the lower thoughts of
sensuous actuality and through the vanity of the intellect, of self-will, and
of self-fulfillment, to destroy faith’s heart, which is motionless and secure
in its submission. However, in fact the Enlightenment marks instead the
beginningofthesublationoftheunthinkingseparation,orinsteadthesep-
aration which is itself devoid of the concept, which is present in faith. The
faithful consciousness weighs and measures by a double standard. It has
twosortsofeyesandears,twotonguesandlanguages,anditdoublesallits
representational thoughts without ever comparing these ambiguities. Or,
faithliveswithintwosortsofperception,oneofwhichisthatoftheslum-
bering,utterlyconceptlessconsciousness,andtheotherthatofthewaking

a separate set of account books in each of them. – The Enlightenment

undone from one another, for both kind belong to the same indivisible
simpleselfintowhichfaithhaspassedover.
573. Faith has thereby lost the content that fulfilled its element, and it
descendsintoweavingakindofdullstupefactionwithinspirititself.Faith
hasbeenbanishedfromitsownrealm,orratherthisrealmhasbeensacked
and plundered, while the waking consciousness in itself ripped up all the
differentiation and dispersal within that realm, claimed those parts as the
earth’sproperty,andreturnedthemtotheearththatownsthem.However,
faith is not for that reason satisfied, for through this illumination, what
has sprouted everywhere is only a singular essence, such that what speaks
tospiritisonlyanessencelessactualityandafinitudeforsakenbyspirit.–
While faith is without content and cannot remain in this emptiness, or
while it goes beyond the finite, which is the sole content, and finds only
emptiness,itisapurelonging.Itstruthisanemptyother-worldlybeyondfor
which there is no longer any adequate content to be found since every-
thing now stands in a different relation. – With that, faith has in fact
become the same as the Enlightenment, namely, the consciousness of the
relationbetweenthefiniteexistinginitselfandapredicate-less,unknown
and unknowable absolute. The only difference is that the Enlightenment
is satisfied Enlightenment, whereas faith is the unsatisfied Enlightenment.
Nonetheless, it is still to be seen whether the Enlightenment can remain
in its satisfaction. The longing on the part of the former tarnished spirit

574. The stupefied weaving by spirit that no longer has any differences

time,theoppositionhasbeenelevatedintothehigher,victoriouselement
in which it manifests itself in a clarified form. Thus, the discord which
arisesinonefaction,andwhichseemstobeamisfortune,provestobeits

576. The pure essence itself has no difference in it. It comes to such a
differenceinthisway:Whatbecomeprominentaretwosuchpureessences
for consciousness, or a twofold consciousness of the pure essence. – The
pureabsoluteessenceisonlyinpurethinking,orratheritispurethinking
itself,anditisthusutterlytheother-worldlybeyondofthefinite,orofself-
consciousness, and is only the negative essence. However, in this manner
it is just being, the negative of self-consciousness. As the negative of self-
consciousness, it is also related to self-consciousness. It is external being,
which in its relation to self-consciousness, within which the distinctions
and determinations fall, receives in it the differences among being tasted,
being seen, and so on. The relationship is thus that of sensuous-certainty
andperception.
577.Ifonestartswiththissensuousbeingintowhichthatformernegative
other-worldlybeyondnecessarilypasses,andonethenabstractsfromthose
determinate modes of the relation of consciousness, what remains is pure
matterasboththedullweavingtogetherofitsownstupefactionandmotion
within itself. It is thereby essential to think about whether pure matter is
onlywhatisleftoverwhenweabstractfromseeing,feeling,tasting,andso
forth, which is to say, matter is not what is seen, tasted, felt, and so on.
Itisnotmatterthatisseen,felt,ortasted,butthecolor,astone,salt,and
so on. Matter is instead pure abstraction, and, as a result, what is present
is the pure essence of thinking, or pure thinking, or pure thinking itself as
the absolute lacking all predicates, undetermined and without differences
withinitself.
578.OneEnlightenmentdubstheabsoluteessencetheformerpredicate-

there to be nature, and spirit or God, and it would lack the conscious-
nessdistinguishingitselfwithinitself.Aswesaw,botharequiteplainlythe 313

leaves the unmoved behind as the empty husk of pure being which is no
longer actual thinking and which no longer has life within itself, for, as
difference, it is all content. However, the movement, which posits itself
as external to that unity, is thereby the flux of the moments which do not
return back into themselves, those ofbeing-in-itself , of being-for-an-other,
andofbeing-for-itself–actualityinthewayinwhichitistheobjectforthe

580. As bad as utility may look to faith or to sentimentality, or even to
that abstraction which calls itself speculation and which fixes on the in-
itself, it is nonetheless in utility that pure insight finalizes its realization
andis,toitself,itsobject,anobjectwhichinsightnownolongerdisavows
andwhichforinsightisnolongervaluedasthevoid,orasthepureother-
worldly beyond. This is so because pure insight is, as we saw, the existing
concept itself, or the pure self-equal personality which is distinguishing
itself within itself in such a way that each of the differences is itself the
pureconcept,whichistosay,isimmediatelynotdistinct.Itissimplepure
self-consciousness which is just as well in an immediate unity for itself as

582.Consciousnesshasfounditsconceptintheprincipleofutility.How-
ever, the concept is still partly an object, and, for that very reason, is still
partly purpose, a purpose in whose possession consciousness does not yet
immediately find itself. Utility is still a predicate of the object, not of the
subjectitself,oritisnotthesubject’simmediateandsoleactuality.Itisthe

However,thisretractionoftheformoftheobjectivityofutilityhasalready
takenplaceinitself,andoutofthisinternalupheaval,theactualupheaval
of actuality is brought forth, the new shape of consciousness, absolute
freedom.
583. In fact, what is now present is nothing more than an empty sem-
blanceofobjectivitywhichseparatesself-consciousnessfrompossession.In
part this is so because all the stable existence and validity of the determi-
natemembersoftheorganizationoftheactualworldandtheworldoffaith
have,assuch,returnedintothissimpledeterminationastheirgroundand

object,consciousnesscognizesthatitsbeing-in-itself isessentiallybeingfor

sive, or what is for another self. However, the object is for consciousness

340 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
317 in this abstract form of pure being-in-itself, is for consciousness pure in-
sight,119 whosedifferenceslieinthepureformofconcepts.–However,the
being-for-itself,intowhichbeingforanotherreturns,ortheself,isnotaself

wisehaveitsownself.Rather,itisthepureconcept,thegazingoftheself
into the self, absolutely seeing-itself-as-doubled. The certainty of itself is
the universal subject, and its knowing concept is the essence of all actu-
ality. However much utility had thus been only the flux of the moments,
wasthusstillanobjectforknowingandwhichdidnotmakeitsreturninto
its own unity, still the flux now ceases to be this, for knowing is itself the
movement of those abstract moments. It is the universal self, the self of
itselfaswellasoftheobject,and,astheuniversalself,itistheunityofthis

584. Thereby spirit as absolute freedom is now present. It is the self-
consciousnesswhichgraspsitselfsothatitscertaintyofitselfistheessence

supersensibleworld,or,conversely,thatessenceandactualityaretheknow-

isnottheemptythoughtofthewill,whichispositedaslyinginatacitor
in a represented120 consent; rather, it is posited as lying in a real universal
will, the will of all singular individuals as such. For the will is in itself the

orthatitistheconceptabsolutely.Whatmadetheconceptintoanexisting
object was its differentiation into isolated, stably existing social estates, but
while the object becomes the concept, there is no longer anything stably
existing in it.121 Negativity has permeated all of its moments. It comes
into existence in such a way that each individual consciousness elevates
itself out of the sphere assigned to it and no longer finds its essence and
its labor within this particularized social estate. Instead, it grasps its self
as the concept of the will, and it grasps all the social estates as the essence 318
of this will; thus it is only able to realize itself in a labor which is a total
labor.Inthisabsolutefreedom,allthesocialestates,whicharethespiritual
essences into which the whole divides itself, are erased. The individual
consciousness that belonged to any such group and which exercised its
willandwhichfounditsfulfillmentthere,hassublateditsboundaries,and
itspurposeisnowtheuniversalpurpose,itslanguagetheuniversallaw,its
worktheuniversalwork.
586. The object and the difference have here lost the meaning of utility,
which was a predicate of all real being. Consciousness does not begin its
movement in it as something alien from which it principally returns into
itself, but rather, to consciousness, the object is consciousness itself, and
the opposition thus consists solely in the difference between singular and
universalconsciousness.However,toitself,thesingularindividualisitself

588. This movement is thereby the reciprocation of consciousness with
itself in which consciousness lets nothing break loose into a shape that
would become a free-standing object confronting it. From this, it follows
that consciousness cannot arrive at a positive work, neither to universal
worksoflanguagenortothoseofactuality,nortothelawsandtheuniver-
salinstitutionsofconsciousfreedom,nortothedeedsandworksofwilling
freedom.–Theworktowhichfreedomgivingitselfconsciousnesscanarrive

objectandalastingbeing.Thisothernesswouldbethedifferenceinthesub-
stance itself, the difference according to which it divided itself both into
stablyexistingspiritualsocialestatesandintotheranksofvariousauthor-

319 as the mere thought-things of a power broken up into legislative, judicial,
and executive powers, but in part they would be the real essences which
emerged in the real world of cultural formation, and, in examining the
contentofuniversaldoingitselfmoreclosely,theywouldbetheparticular

self that is One.125 However, as a result, all other singular individuals are
excluded from the totality of this deed, and they only have a restricted
share in it, so that the deed could not be a deed of actual universal self-
consciousness. – Universal freedom can thus produce neither a positive

finds its reality to be totally other than what its concept of itself was,

of personality, and that personality is supposed to know itself only posi-
tively within the universal will, or to know itself as preserved. Rather, for

the universal will, because it is this self-conscious actuality raised to pure
thinking or to abstract matter, completely changes over into the negative
essence, and proves just as much to be the sublation of thinking-thinking-
itself,129 orofself-consciousness.
593. As the pure self-equality of the universal will, absolute freedom
thus has the negation in it but as a result has the difference as such in it,
129 Sich-selbst-denkens.
(BB)Spirit 345
and it develops this again asactual difference. For in the self-equal uni-
versal will, pure negativity has the element of stable existence, or thesub-
stance within which its moments realize themselves, and it has the matter
whichitcanputtoworkinitsdeterminateness,andtotheextentthatthis

the organization of the spiritual social estates again takes shape, the orga-
nization to which the multitude of individual consciousnesses are appor-

onenesswithself-consciousness,oritisthepurelypositivebecauseitisthe
purely negative, and within its inner concept the meaningless death, the
unfulfillednegativityoftheself,changesoversuddenlyintoabsolutepos-
itivity. For consciousness, the immediate unity of itself with the universal
will, its demand to know itself as this determinate point in the universal
will, transforms itself into the utterly opposite experience. What vanishes
for it there is the abstract being, or the immediacy of that substance-less
point, and this vanished immediacy is the universal will itself, which it
now knows itself to be to the extent that it is sublated immediacy, or pure
knowingorpurewill.Ittherebyknowsthatwilltobeitself,anditknows

595. Absolute freedom has thus offset the opposition which the will
had between itself as the universal will and as the singular will. The self-
alienated spirit, driven to the peak of its opposition in which pure will-

C. SpiritCertainofItself:Morality
596. The ethical world showed that its fate and its truth were only the
departed spirit in that world, the singular self. However, this person of
the law has its substance and its fulfillment outside of that ethical world.
The movement of the world of cultural formation and of faith sublates
this abstraction of the person, and through the perfected alienation and
the highest abstraction, the substance initially, to the self of spirit, comes
tobetheuniversalwillandthenfinallycomesintospirit’sownpossession.
Hereknowingthusfinallyseemstohavebecomecompletelythesameasits
truth, for its truth is this knowing itself, and allopposition between both
aspectshasvanished,infact,notforus,orinitself,butforself-consciousness
itself. That is to say, self-consciousness has itself gained mastery over the
opposition of consciousness. This latter rests on the opposition between 324
the certainty of itself and the object, but now the object is, to itself, the
certaintyofitself.Itisknowing–justasthecertaintyofitselfassuchcer-
taintynolongerhasanypurposesofitsown,andthusnolongerisinthe

597. To self-consciousness, its knowing is therefore the substance itself.
For it, this substance is as much immediately in one undivided unity as it
isabsolutelymediated.Immediate–justlikeethicalconsciousness,itboth
knowsits dutyanddoesits duty, anditbelongstoitasitdoestoitsown

599. Self-consciousness knows duty as the absolute essence. It is bound
only by duty, and this substance is its own pure consciousness. For self-
consciousness,dutycannotassumetheformofsomethingalien.However,
325 moral self-consciousness, when resolved in that way within itself, is not
yet posited and regarded as consciousness. The object is immediate know-
ing, and, as so purely permeated by the self, it is not an object. However,

Dutycounts,toitself,astheessence,and,toitself,theessenceisactualand

602. Moral consciousness cannot renounce happiness and leave this 326
moment out of its absolute purpose. The purpose, which is expressed as
pure duty, essentially contains in it this singular self-consciousness. Both
the individual conviction and the knowing of this conviction constituted
an absolute moment of morality. This moment in the purpose which has

which does lie in the concept of the actualization of morality. However,

does not aim at remaining a disposition in contrast to action; it aims at
action, or at actualizing itself. The purpose, expressed as both the whole
andtheconsciousnessofitsmoments,thereforeamountstothefollowing.
Duty fulfilled is supposed to be just as much a purely moral action as it
is a realized individuality, and nature, as the aspect of singularity in con-
trast with abstract purpose, is supposed to be at one with this purpose. –

However, the thought that a perfected morality would contain a contra-
diction would harm the holiness of moral essentiality, and absolute duty
wouldthenappearassomethingnon-actual.

605. As the simple knowing and willing of pure duty in acting, moral
consciousness is related to an object opposed to its simplicity – related
to the actuality of the diverse cases, and as a result it has a diverse moral
relationshiptothatactuality.Accordingtothecontent,whatemergeshere
is the plurality of laws, and according to the form, what emerges are the
contradictorypowersofknowingconsciousnessandoftheunconscious.–
At the outset, with regard to the plurality of duties, what counts for the
moral consciousness is only the pure duty within them. The many duties,
asmany,aredeterminateandassucharethusnothingholyformoralcon-
sciousness.However,atthesametimeandnecessarilythroughtheconcept
of acting, which itself encompasses a diverse actuality and thus a diverse
329 moral relation, those many duties must be regarded as existing in and for
themselves.Furthermore,sincetheycanonlybewithinamoralconscious-
ness, they are at the same time within a consciousness other than that for

minate content, and duty is only this indifference with respect to content.
(BB)Spirit 353
Buttheotherconsciousnesscontainstheequallyessentialrelationtoacting
and the necessity of determinate content. While duties count, to itself, as
determinate duties, the content as such is, to itself, just as essential as the
form through which the content is a duty. This consciousness is thereby
the kind in which the universal and the particular are utterly at one, and
itsconceptisthusthesameastheconceptoftheharmonyofmoralityand

the first postulate expresses only the existing harmony between morality
andnaturebecausenatureisthereinthisnegativeofself-consciousness,the
moment of being, still this in-itself is in contrast now posited essentially
asconsciousness. Forwhatexistsnow hastheformofthe content ofduty,
or is the determinateness in the determinate duty. The in-itself is thus the
unity of the sort of items which are as simple essentialities, as essentialities
of thinking, and which thus only are within a consciousness. This latter
consciousnessisthusnowalordandruleroftheworldwhogeneratesthe
harmonyofmoralityandhappinessandatthesametimesanctifiesduties
as a plurality of duties. In turn, that means this much: For the conscious-
nessofpureduty,thedeterminatedutycannotbeimmediatelysanctified.
Because the determinate duty, in the service of actual action which is a
determinate action, is likewise necessary, so does its necessity fall outside
of that consciousness into another consciousness, which is thereby what
mediates the determinate and the pure duty and is the reason why that
specificdutyalsocountsasvalid.

608.Becauseitisherebypositedthatthevalidityofdutyastheholyin
andforitself fallsoutsideofactualconsciousness,thisconsciousnessassuch 330
thereby stands off to one side as incomplete moral consciousness. Accord-
ing to its knowing, it therefore knows itself to be the sort whose knowing
and conviction is incomplete and contingent. Just as much according to
354 ThePhenomenologyofSpirit
its willing, it knows itself to be the sort whose purposes are affected by
sensibility. According to its unworthiness, it thus cannot look on happi-
nessasnecessarybutratherassomethingcontingent,anditcanonlyexpect
happinesstoissuefromgrace.
609. However, even though its actuality is incomplete, duty nonethe-

ingandwillingcountasperfected,andastakingthisimperfectiontohave
full weight, it thereby also apportions happiness according to worthiness,
namely,accordingtothedesertascribedtotheimperfectconsciousness.
610.Withthat,themoralworldviewiscompleted,forintheconceptof
moralself-consciousness,thetwoaspects,thoseofpuredutyandactuality,
are posited as being in a single unity, and as a result both the one as well
as the other are each posited not as existing in and for themselves but as
a moment, or as sublated. In the last part of the moral worldview, it is for
consciousness that this comes to be. That is to say, consciousness posits
puredutyaslyinginanotheressencethanitself,i.e.,itpositspuredutyas
somethingwhichitpartlyhasassomethingrepresentedandwhichitpartly
hasassomethingwhichisnotvalidinandforitself,butitisthenon-moral
consciousness which instead counts as completed. It likewise posits itself
as having an actuality which is unsuited to duty, which is sublated, and
which,assublated,oraslyingintherepresentationoftheabsoluteessence,
nolongercontradictsmorality.
611. However, for the moral consciousness itself, its moral worldview
does not mean that moral consciousness develops its own concept within
that worldview and makes that concept its object to itself. It neither has
a consciousness concerning this opposition of form nor a consciousness
concerningthisopposition,whoseparts,accordingtotheircontent,itnei-
ther relates nor compares with each other. Rather, it rolls onward in its
development without being the concept holding those moments together.
Thisissobecauseitonlyknowsthepureessence,ortheobjectinsofarasthe

This unity is thus itself actual; it is an actual moral consciousness. – The
latter now, as consciousness, represents its content to itself as an object,
namely, as the final purpose of the world, as the harmony of morality with
all actuality. However, while representing this unity as object and not yet
theconceptwhichhaspowerovertheobjectassuchanobject,thisunity
is, to itself, a negative of self-consciousness, or the unity falls outside of

and actuality; this unity thus becomes, to itself, the object as perfected

actuallynon-moral,becauseitisjustasmuchpurethinkingandsublimely

moral and is taken to be entirely valid. In this way, the first proposi-
tion, namely, that there is a moral self-consciousness, is produced, but it
is combined with the second, namely, that there is none, that is, there is a
moral self-consciousness but only in representational thought; or there is
indeed no moral self-consciousness, but it is accepted as one by another
self-consciousness.

ness in any kind of unconscious way. Rather, throughout all of this, con-

it knows itself as active consciousness, which creates the essence. It thereby
seemstoachieveitsreposeanditssatisfaction,forthesecanonlybefound
where it no longer needs to go above and beyond its object because this
object no longer goes above and beyond it. However, on the other side

use a most appropriately Kantian phrase here, a whole nest of thoughtless
contradictions.Consciousnessconductsitselfinthisdevelopmentinsuch
a way that it fixes one moment, and from there immediately passes over
to an other, and then sublates the first. However, as soon as it has now
put forth this second moment, it also again dissembles about this moment
and instead makes the opposite into the essence. At the same time, it is

that it brings into the present what is not supposed to be in the present.
And as the harmony is postulated for the sake of the action – which is to
say, that what is supposed to become actual through action must be that
139 vorhanden.

However, the purpose of reason as the all-comprehensive universal pur-
pose,isnothinglessthanthewholeworlditself,afinalendwhichgoesfar
beyondthecontentofthisindividualactionandthusistobeplacedalto-
gether beyond all actual acting. Because the universally best ought to be
put into practice, nothing good is done. However, in fact the nothingness
of actual acting and the reality only of the whole end, which are now put
forward, are according to all the aspects again a matter of dissemblance.
Moral action is not something contingent and restricted, for it has pure
dutyforitsessence;thispuredutyconstitutesthesingleentireend;andthe
action,astheactualizationofthatend,istheaccomplishmentoftheentire
absoluteend,whateverotherrestrictionstheremaybeonthecontent.Or,
if actuality is again taken to be nature, which has its own laws and which
is opposed to pure duty so that duty cannot realize its law within nature,
then while duty as such is the essence, this in fact has nothing to do with
the accomplishment of pure duty, which is the entire end, for that accom-
plishmentwouldinsteadhaveasitsendnotpuredutybutinsteadwhatis

620.Ifweallowthishighestgoodtocountastheessence,thenconscious-
ness is not at all serious about morality. This is so because in the highest
good, nature does not have a different law from that of morality. Moral
actingitselfthusbreaksdown,forthereisactiononlyunderthepresuppo-
sition of a negative which is to be sublated through the action. However,
if nature is in accordance with ethical laws, then these ethical laws would
beviolatedbyaction,orbythesublationofwhatexists.–Inthatassump-
tion about the essential condition, there is the admission that there is a

all.Seenfromthisaspect,thepostulateoftheharmonybetweenmorality
andactuality–ofaharmonypositedbytheconceptofmoralactionwhich
is to bring the two into agreement – is expressed in the following way:
Becausemoralactingistheabsolutepurpose,thentheabsolutepurposeis
thatmoralactingwouldnotatallbesaidtobepresent.
621. If we collect these moments together in which consciousness has
rolledforwardinitsmorallyrepresentationalthinking,140 itbecomesclear
thatitagainsublateseachofthoserepresentationalthinkingsintoitsoppo-
site. It starts from the position that for it morality and actuality do not 335
harmonize, but, to itself, it is not serious about it, for in the action this
harmony is for it in the present. However, to itself, it is also not serious
about this action, for it is something singular, for it has such a lofty pur-
pose, the highest good. But this is again only a dissemblance about what is
really at issue, for in that dissemblance all action and all morality would
fallbythewayside.Or,itisthat,toitself,itisnotgenuinelyseriousabout
moral action, but rather it holds that what is most desirable, the abso-
lute,isthatthehighestgoodbeputintopracticeandthatmoralactionbe
superfluous.
622. On the basis of this result, consciousness must advance further in
itscontradictorymovement,andagainitnecessarilydissemblesaboutthe
sublating of moral action. Morality is the in-itself; for morality to come
about,thefinalendoftheworldcannotberealized,butrather,moralcon-
sciousness must be for itself, and it must find that it confronts a nature
which is opposed to it. However, in its own self it must be completed, and
this leads to the second postulate of the harmony of itself and the nature
which is immediately in it, namely, sensibility. Moral self-consciousness
puts forward the view that its purpose is pure purpose, independent of
inclinations and impulses so that the pure purpose has eliminated within
itself sensibility’s purposes. – Yet this proposed sublation of the sensuous
essenceisagainmadeintoamatterofdissemblance.Moralconsciousness
acts,bringsitspurposeintoactualityandself-conscioussensibility,which
oughttobesublated,ispreciselythemediatingmiddlebetweenpurecon-
sciousness and actuality. – It is the former’s instrument, or organ, for its
realization, and it is what is called impulse, inclination; hence, it is not
reallyseriousaboutsublatinginclinationsandimpulses,foritisjustthese
which are the self-actualizing self-consciousness. However, they should also
not be suppressed, but rather, only to be in accordance with reason. They

are also in accordance with reason, for moral action is nothing but self-

impulseisinfactnotonlythisemptyshapewhichmighthavewithinitself

This is so because sensibility is a nature which contains in its own self its
ownlawsandspringsofaction,andthusmoralitycannotbeseriousabout
thedrivingforceforthedrivesortheangleofinclinationforinclinations.
For, while these latter have their own fixed determinateness and distinc-
tive content, the consciousness with which they were to conform would
insteadbeinaccordancewiththem,andthisisaconformitywhichmoral
self-consciousness refuses totolerate. The harmony between the twothus
336 is only in itself and is postulated. – In moral action, the current harmony
ofmoralityandsensibilityhadbeenputforthasaview,butnoweventhis
is a matter of dissemblance. The harmony is an other-worldly beyond of
consciousness,lyingsomewhereoffinafoggydistanceinwhichthereisno
longeranythingwhichcanbeaccuratelydifferentiatedorcomprehended,
sincethecomprehensionofthisunity,whichwejustattemptedtoprovide,
itself failed. – However, within this in-itself, consciousness gives itself up
altogether. This in-itself is its moral completion within which the strug-
gle of morality and sensibility has ceased, and the latter is in accordance
withtheformerinawaywhichcannotbegrasped.–Forthatreason,this
completion is again only a dissemblance about what is really at issue, for
in that completion morality would instead be abandoned, since morality
is only consciousness of the absolute purpose as pure purpose, and there-
foreasopposingallotherpurposes.Moralityisjustasawareoftheactivity
of this pure purpose as it is aware of its elevation above sensibility, aware
of the intrusion of sensibility, and aware of the opposition and struggle
with sensibility. – Consciousness itself immediately expresses that it does
nottakethismoralcompletionseriouslybyitsdissemblanceabouttheway
this culmination is put off into infinity, which is to say, by asserting that
thiscompletionisnevercompleted.
623. What is valid is thus instead only the in-between state of incom-
pletion, a state that nonetheless is supposed to be at least progress towards
completion. Yet it also cannot be this progress, for progress in morality
wouldreallybeprogresstowardsitsowndownfall.Theaimwouldbethe
nothingness mentioned above, or the sublation of morality and of con-
sciousness itself; however, to get ever nearer and nearer to nothing is to
decrease. Besides, to make progress as such (as well as to decrease as such)
would equally make the assumption that there are differences of quantity

626. Morality is therefore not completed in moral consciousness. This
is what is now being proposed, but the essence of moral consciousness is
just to be completed purity, and incomplete morality is thus impure, or is
immorality.Moralityitselfthusisinanotheressencethaninthatofactual
consciousness, and this other is a holy moral legislator. – The morality
whichisnotcompletedinconsciousness,theverymoralitywhichisthebasis

ness.–Itisthusnotanymoreseriousabouttheclaimthatthisotherbeing
is a holy being, for in that holy being142 something should have arrived
at essentiality, which, for moral consciousness, i.e., in itself, has no such
essentiality.
627. However much the holy essence had been postulated so that duty
would have its validity within it, not as pure duty but as a plurality of
determinate duties, still this must again be a matter of dissemblance, and
the other being143 alone would have to be holy only insofar as it is only
the pure duty in it which has validity. In fact, pure duty too has validity
onlyinanotherbeing144 andnotinmoralconsciousness.Althoughinthe
latter, it is pure morality alone which seems to be valid, still this moral
consciousness must be taken in another way, for it is at the same time a

natural consciousness. Within natural consciousness, morality is affected

acontingencyoffreewilling,butaspurewillingwithinnaturalconscious-

628. This being146 is therefore here the purely completed morality for
thereasonthatwithinitmoralitydoesnotstandinanyrelationtonature

andsensibility.Moralconsciousnesspositsthatitsincompletionliesinthe

and I fulfill a determinate duty; there is something other therein than the
pure duty which was alone supposed to be kept in view. – On the other

in a determinate actuality, the actuality of consciousness itself, not in the
sense that is a thought-thing but rather in the sense that it is a singular
individual. Conscience has its truth for itself in the immediate certainty of
itself.Thisimmediateconcretecertaintyofitselfistheessence.Ifthatself-

theself,thatistosay,asimpleself whichisasmuchpureknowingasitis
knowingofitselfas thissingularlyindividualconsciousness. Thisselfthus
constitutes the content of what was formerly the empty essence, for it is
the actual, which no longer has the significance of being, within its own
laws, a self-sufficient nature alien to the essence. As the negative, it is the
differenceofthepureessence,acontent,indeed,thekindofcontentwhich
isvalidinandforitself.
639. Furthermore, as self-equal pure knowing, this self is the univer-
sal pure and simple, such that it is just this knowing as its own knowing,
as conviction, which is duty. Duty is no longer the universal confronting
the self. Rather, duty is known to have no validity when it is separated
in that way. The law now exists for the sake of the self and not the other
way around, not the self existing for the sake of the law. But for that rea-
son law and duty do not signify being-for-itself alone. Rather, they also
signify being-in-itself, for on account of its self-equality, this knowing is
just the in-itself. In consciousness this in-itself separates itself from that
former immediate unity with being-for-itself; facing off in that way, this
in-itself is being, being for others. – Duty, as duty deserted by the self, is
now known to be only a moment. It has sunken from meaning the abso-
luteessence,tomeaningonly“being,”whichisnottheself,whichisnotfor
itself,andisthusabeingforothers.However,forthatveryreason,thisbeing
for others remains an essential moment because the self, as consciousness,

640. This being for others is thus the substance existing-in-itself, differ-
entiated from the self. Conscience has not abandoned pure duty, or the
abstract in-itself; rather, pure duty is the essential moment in its conduct-
ingitselfasuniversalitytowardsothers.Conscienceisthecommonelement
of self-consciousnesses, and self-consciousness is the substance in which
the deed has stable existence and actuality, the moment of coming-to-be-

action is supposed to occur, and it must be determined by the individual.
Moreover, spirit certain of itself, in which the in-itself has arrived at the
significance of the self-conscious I, knows that it has this determination,
this content, in the immediate certainty of its own self. As determination

the pure immediate truth, and this truth is thus its immediate certainty
ofitselfrepresentedascontent,i.e.,thearbitraryfreechoiceofthesingular
individualandthecontingencyofhisunconsciousnaturalbeing.
644. At the same time this content counts as moral essentiality, or as
duty because, as was already shown in the testing of laws, pure duty is
utterly indifferent to every content and is compatible with any content.

tie every content to this form and can attach its conscientiousness to any

Because morality lies in the consciousness of having fulfilled one’s duty,
thisconsciousnesswillnotbelackingwhentheactingiscalled“cowardice”

“duty” is capable of each and every content – it thus knows what it does
as duty, and while it knows this, and knows that the conviction of duty
is dutifulness itself, it is thus recognized by others. As a result, the action
countsasvalidandhasactualexistence.

independently of the singular individual’s knowing and conviction as well
ashisownimmediateinterest.Itisthusthatagainstwhoseformmorality

Rather, it is spirit which has returned into itself, is certain of itself, cer-

the spirit which is recognized as this knowing. The language of ethical
spirit is the law, the simple commandment, and it is the lament, which
is more that of shedding a tear over necessity. Moral consciousness con-

itself,somethingotherthanthehiddeninwardnessandtheimmediacyof

conscience the difference between its abstract consciousness and its self-
consciousness sublates itself. It knows that abstract consciousness is just

therelationoftheselftothein-itself,which,positedasexternaltotheself,
is the abstract essence and is hidden from the self, the diversity [ofthis] is

innermost to itself, for which all externality as such has vanished – it has

consciousness, it is separated into the opposition between itself and the

cisely what is completely transparent, it is its own self, and its conscious-

receded into this self and have lost their diversity from the I-self. The
moments of consciousness are therefore these extreme abstractions, nei-
ther of which holds its ground but each of which loses itself in the other
and generates the other. It is the flux of the unhappy consciousness with
itself, but which takes place this time inside itself, so that this time it is
conscious of being the concept of reason, something which the unhappy

evil consciousness appealed to its own law. This is so because the former

is in its own self diverse in its many-sidedness. It has both the universal

judged in such a way, for duty for duty’s sake, this pure purpose, is the
non-actual. It has its actuality in what individuality does, and as a result,
(BB)Spirit 385
the action has the aspect of particularity in itself. – No man is a hero to
his valet, but not because that man is not a hero, but rather because the
latter is– a valet,a person withwhomthe hero dealsnot as ahero but as

666. The judging consciousness is itself thereby base because it divides
uptheaction,anditbothbringsoutandholdsontotheaction’sinequal-
ity with itself. Furthermore, it is hypocrisy because he pretends that such
judgment is not only another manner of being evil but is rather itself the
rightful consciousness of action. In his non-actuality and in the vanity he
has in being such a faultfinder,176 he places himself far above the deeds it
excoriates, and he wants to know that his speech, which is utterly devoid
of any deeds, is to be taken as a superior actuality. – In thereby making
himself equal to the agent about whom it is so judgmental, the judging
consciousness is thus known177 by that consciousness to be the same as
himself.Thelatterconsciousnessnotonlyfindshimselftohavebeentaken

672. In the previous shapes, which broadly differentiated themselves into
consciousness, self-consciousness, reason, andspirit, there is something else
which has also come forth, namely, religion as the consciousness of abso-
luteessence,yetitwastobefoundthereonlyaccordingtothestandpoint
ofconsciousnessthatisawareoftheabsoluteessence.However,theabsolute
essenceinandforitself,theself-consciousnessofspirit,hasnotappearedin

673. Consciousness, to the extent that it is the understanding, already
becomes consciousness of the supersensible, or consciousness of the inner
ofobjectiveexistence.However,thesupersensible,theeternal,orwhatever
elseonemaycallit,isdevoidofself.1 Initially,itisonlytheuniversalwhich
is still some distance removed from spirit knowing itself as spirit. – Fol-
lowing that was self-consciousness, which had its completion in the shape
of the unhappy consciousness, which itself is only the grief of spirit as it
struggled and then failed to force itself outwards again towards objectiv-
ity. The unity of singular self-consciousness with what is its unchangeable
essence,towardswhichsingularself-consciousnessbringsitself,thusremains
another-worldlybeyondforself-consciousness.–Boththeimmediateexis-
tence of reason, which emerged for us from out of that grief, and reason’s
own distinctive shapes have no religion, because the self-consciousness of

devoid of consciousness, which neither arrives at difference within itself,
nortotheclarityofknowing-itself.
675. This faith in the nothingness of necessity and in the netherworld 364
becomes faith in heaven, because the departed self must unite itself with
itsuniversality,musthammerapartwhatitiswithinthatuniversalitythat
the self contains and in that way become clear to itself. However, we saw
this realm of faith unfold its conceptless content only within the element
of thinking, and for that reason, we saw it perish in its fate, namely, in
the religionof theEnlightenment. In thereligion of theEnlightenment, the
supersensible other-worldly beyond of the understanding is again estab-
lished, but in such a way that self-consciousness stands satisfied in this-
worldliness, and it knows the empty supersensible other-worldly beyond,
whichisneithercognizablenorfrightful,neitherasaselfnoraspower.
676.Inthereligionofmorality,itisfinallyre-establishedthattheabso-
lute essence is a positive content, but that content is conjoined with the

677. Within religion, spirit knowing itself is immediately its own pure
self-consciousness. Those shapes of spirit that have been examined – the
truespirit,self-alienatedspirit,andspiritcertainofitself–togetherconsti-
tute spirit in its consciousness, which, confronting its world, does not cog-
nizeitselfinthatworld.However,withinconscience,spiritsubjugatesitself

representational thought and its determinate concepts, and it is now self-

678. While in religion, the underlying consciousness of spirit’s deter-
mination does not therefore have the form of free-standing otherness, its
existenceisdistinctfromitsself-consciousness,anditsgenuineactualityfalls
outsideofreligion.Thereis,tobesure,onespiritofboth,butitsconscious-
ness does not embrace both together, and religion appears as one part of
existence, as one part of various doings and strivings, whose other part is
the life in spirit’s actual world. Just as we now know that both spirit in

becomingthesameastheother,andnotonlysothatreligionoccupiesitself
withspirit’sactuality,but,conversely,sothatthatspirit,asspiritconscious

ness.–Totheextentthatspiritinreligionthinksofitselfrepresentationally,
itisindeedconsciousness,andtheactualityimplicitwithinreligionisthe
shapeandthegarmentofitsrepresentation.However,inthiskindofrep-
resentational thought, actuality does not receive its full due, namely, that
it is not only a garment, it is also a free-standing self-sufficient existence.
Conversely,becauseactualitylacksconsummationwithinitself,itisadeter-
minate shape that does not attain what it is supposed to exhibit, namely,
spirit conscious of itself. For that spirit’s shape to express spirit itself, the
shapewouldhavetobenothingelsebutspirititself;spiritwouldhavehad
to appear to itself or would have to be actual in the way spirit is in its
essence. Solely as a result, what would have been achieved might seem to
demandtheveryopposite,namely,thattheobjectofitsconsciousnesshave
at the same time the form of free-standing actuality. However, the spirit
which is object, to itself, only as absolute spirit is the spirit which is, to
itself, an equally free-standing actuality as it remains therein conscious of
itself.
679. While initially self-consciousness and consciousness proper, reli-
gion and spirit in its world, or the existence of spirit, are differentiated,
the latter consists in the whole of spirit insofar as its moments are exhib-
ited as each coming undone from the others and each presenting itself

supposes the whole course of the development of those moments, and it
is their simple totality, or their absolute self. – In addition, in relation to
religion,thecoursethosemomentstravelisnottoberepresentedastaking
place in time. Only the whole spirit is in time, and the shapes, which are
shapes of the whole spirit as such, exhibit themselves in a sequence, one
after the other, for only the whole has genuine actuality, and the whole
thus has the form of pure freedom with regard to others, which expresses
itself as time. However, the moments of spirit as a whole (consciousness,

680. However much religion is thus the consummation of spirit, into
which, as their ground, the singular moments of spirit (consciousness,
self-consciousness, reason, and spirit) both return and have returned, still
together they constitute the existing actuality of the whole spirit, which
is only as the differentiating movement of its aspects returning back into

681. In this way, the shapes which have thus far come on the scene are
now ordered differently from the way they appeared in their own series.
367 A few short remarks about this are necessary before we go any further. –
In the series which was under examination, each moment, going deeper
and deeper into itself, formed itself into a whole with its own distinctive
principle, and cognition was the depth, or the spirit, within which the
moments, which have no stable existence for themselves, had their sub-
stance.However,fromthispointon,thissubstancehassteppedout[into
view]; this substance is the depth of spirit certain of itself, which does
not allow the singular principle to isolate itself and to make itself into
a whole within itself. Rather, collecting all these moments within itself
and holding them all together, this substance advances within this total
wealth of its actual spirit, and all of its particular moments communally
takeintothemselvesandreceiveintothemselvesthesamedeterminateness
ofthewhole.–Thisself-certainspiritanditsmovementaretheirgenuine
actuality and the being-in-and-for-itself which corresponds to each single
one. – However much, therefore, one of the previous series in its forward
movement through the nodes [of the whole series] marked a regression
within the series but then again continued out of those regressions in a
single longitude,7 still henceforth, it is, as it were, broken at these nodes,

that the same differences, within which each moment itself gave itself a
shape,allmeettogether.–Inaddition,itisclearfromtheentireexposition

ofitssubstance,butinreligion,theyareinsteadonlypredicatesofthesub-
ject.–Likewise,inthemselvesorforus,allformsareindeedbothcontained
within spirit and within each spirit. However, what is solely at issue in
spirit’s actuality per se has to do with the specific determinateness which
is there for spirit within its consciousness, or the determinateness in which
spiritexpressesitsownself,orinwhichshapespiritknowsitsessence.
682.Thedifferencewhichwasmadebetweenactualspiritandthespirit
that knows itself as spirit, or between itself as consciousness and as self-
consciousness, is sublated within the spirit that knows itself according to
itstruth;itsconsciousnessanditsself-consciousnesshavecounter-balanced
eachother.However,asreligionishereinitiallyimmediate,thisdifference
has not yet returned into spirit. It is only the concept of religion which is
posited. In the concept, the essence is self-consciousness, which, to itself, is
alltruthandwhichcontainsallrealitywithinthattruth.Asconsciousness,
this self-consciousness has itself for its object; spirit, knowing itself only
immediately,is,toitself,thereforespiritintheformofimmediacy,andthe
determinateness of the shape in which it appears to itself is that of being.

namely,itsknowingofitselfaccordingtothissingulardeterminateness,does
not in fact exhaust the whole of an actual religion. The series of different
religions, which will result from this, will again only exhibit the different
aspects of a single religion, indeed of each religion. Moreover, the repre-
sentational thoughts12 which seem to mark off one actual religion from
another appear in each and every one of them. Yet, at the same time, the

theshapeswhichthatconsciousnesscontainsalsohavingthemomentsof

darkness; the movements of its own self-relinquishing, its creations in the
unresistingelementsofitsotherness,arealleffusionsoflight,andintheir
simplicity they are at the same time both its coming-to-be-for-itself and
its return out of its existence, or the shapes of consuming streams of fire.

is the religion of spiritual perception, within which it falls apart into an
innumerable plurality of weaker and stronger, richer and poorer spirits.
This pantheism, which is initially the motionless stable existence of these
spiritual atoms, becomes a hostile movement within itself. The innocence
oftheflowerreligion,whichisonlyarepresentationoftheselfvoidofany
self,passesoverintotheseriousnessofwarringlife,intotheguiltofanimal
religion; the motionless being and the impotence of intuiting individual-
ity passes over into destructive being-for-itself. – It does not help to have
taken the death of abstraction away from the things of perception and to
have elevated them into the essence of spiritual perception; the ensouling
ofthisspiritualrealmhasthatdeaththroughthedeterminatenessandthe
negativityinitwhichmakeitencroachontheinnocentindifferenceofthat
religion.Itisthroughthisdeterminatenessandnegativitythatthedispersal
into the manifoldness of the motionless shapes of plants becomes a hos-
tilemovementinwhichthehatredoftheirbeing-for-itselfgraduallywears
itself out. – The actual self-consciousness within this dispersed spirit is a
multitudeofthinned-outandunsociablespiritsofdifferentpeoples,who,
intheirhatred,battlewitheachothertothedeathandbecomeconscious
of determinate shapes of animals as their essence, for they themselves are
nothing more than animal spirits, segregating themselves from their con-
sciousanimallife,bereftofuniversality.
690. However, in this hatred, the determinateness of purely negative
being-for-itself gradually wears itself out, and through this movement of
the concept, spirit enters into another shape. The sublated being-for-itself
istheformoftheobject,aformwhichisbroughtforthbytheself,orwhich
istheengenderedselfinsteadwearingitselfout,i.e.,theselfasitbecomes
athing.Hence,thelaborerretainstheupperhandovertheseanimalspirits
which are only tearing each other apart, the very laborer whose doing is
not only negative but rather is a steady hand and is positive. Therefore,
373 the consciousness of spirit is henceforth the movement that is above and
beyond immediate being-in-itself as well as abstract being-for-itself. While

c. TheArtisan
691. Spirit therefore here appears as the artisan, and his doing, whereby
he brings forth himself as object, although not yet having taken hold of
the thought of himself, is an instinctive kind of working, much like bees
buildingtheircells.
692.Thefirstform,becauseitistheimmediateone,istheabstractform
of the understanding, and the work is not yet in its own self suffused by
spirit. The crystals of the pyramids and of the obelisks, simple combina-
tions of straight lines with even surfaces and equal relations of parts in
whichtheincommensurabilityofroundnessisabolished,aretheworksof
this artisan of rigorous form. On account of the bare intelligibility of the
form, the form is not its meaning in its own self, not the spiritual self.
Thoseworksthereforeeitheronlyreceivespiritintothemselvesasanalien,
departed spirit which has abandoned its living permeation with actuality,
and which, being itself dead, comes to reside in these lifeless crystals: –
Ortheyrelatethemselvesexternallytospiritassomethingwhichisthere19
externally and not as spirit itself – to spirit as the light rising in the east,
whichcastsitsmeaningonthem.
693. The separation from which the laboring spirit originates, the
separation between being-in-itself, which becomes the material which it
processes, and being-for-itself, which is the aspect of the laboring self-
consciousness, has, to itself, become objective in its work. Its further
endeavor has to set itself to sublating this separation of soul and body,
to clothing and shaping the soul in its own self and ensouling the body.
Both aspects, while they are brought closer to each other, thereby retain
withregardtoeachotherthedeterminatenessofrepresentedspiritandits
envelopingshell;spirit’sonenesswithitselfcontainsthisoppositionofsin- 374

thing to be used, and he repositions it back to being an external aspect,
anornament.However,itisnotputtosuchusewithoutalteration;atthe
same time, the laborer of that self-conscious form destroys the transience
of this life which the immediate existence of this life has in itself, and he
brings its organic forms nearer to the more rigorous and universal forms

otherhand,theartisanelevatesthesestraight-linedandlevelshapesintoa

695. This dwelling, the aspect of the universal element, or the aspect of
the inorganic nature of spirit, also now includes within itself a shape of
singular individuality that brings nearer to actuality the spirit which had
formerly been either external or internal to existence but which had been
isolated from existence. By doing so, he makes the work more equal to
active self-consciousness. The worker at first resorts to the form of being-

698. Within this work, instinctual labor ceases, namely, the labor
which,inoppositiontoself-consciousness,broughtforththeunconscious
work, for within it, the activity of the artisan, which constitutes self-
consciousness, encounters an equally self-conscious, self-expressing inner.

700. If we then ask which spirit is the actual spirit that has its con-
sciousness of its absolute essence in the art-religion, it turns out that it is
the ethical, or the true spirit. The ethical spirit is not only the universal

it has the shape of consciousness, what this amounts to is that, as it itself
hasindividualization,itisknownbythosesingularindividualsastheirown

unitythebeing-for-itselfofself-consciousnessiscontainedonlynegatively,
onlytransitorily,andinwhichself-consciousnessintuitsthelordandmas-
ter of its actuality, nor is it the restless way that self-hating peoples con-

it is a free people, within whom the ethos20 constitutes the substance of

701.However,thereligionofethicalspiritisitselevationaboveitsactu-

anethicalpeoplelivesinimmediateunitywithitssubstanceanddoesnot
have the principle of the pure singular individuality of self-consciousness
inthemselves,theirreligioninitiallycomesonthesceneinitsconsumma-
tion in its divorce from its stable existence. This is so because theactuality
of the ethical substance rests in part on its motionless unchangeableness as
opposed to the absolute movement of self-consciousness, and it is thus
basedonthisself-consciousnessnotyethavingtakentheinwardturnfrom

whichonlyfindsitsrestandcohesioninthesimplicityofspiritcertainof

fate of the ethical world is therefore the individuality that has taken the

at a boundless joyfulness and the freest enjoyment of itself. This simple
certainty of spirit within itself has a double meaning, that of motionless
stable existence and solid truth, as well as that of absolute unrest and the
passingofethicallife.However,itturnsaroundintothelatter,forthetruth
ofethicalspiritisonlythissubstantialessenceandtrust,withinwhichthe
self does not know itself as free singular individuality, and which thus in
thisinwardness,orwithintheself’scomingtobefree,meetsitsdownfall.
While its trust is therefore broken, and while the substance of the people
is therefore shattered, spirit, which was the mediating middle of the two
unstably existing extremes, henceforth stands out as the extreme of self-
consciousness grasping itself as essence. This is spirit certain within itself,
which mourns over the loss of its world, and now, from out of the purity
oftheself,engendersitsownessence,elevatedaboveactuality.
702. In such epochs, absolute art comes on the scene; prior to this, art
isinstinctuallabor,which,immersedinexistence,worksitselfbothoutof
it and into it; it does not have its substance in a free ethical life and thus
thelaboringselfalsodoesnothavefreespiritualactivity.Later,spiritgoes

704. The existence of the pure concept into which spirit has fled from 378
its body is an individual that spirit elects to be the vessel for its anguish.

he suffers violence – as his pathos, thanks to which his self-consciousness

and has given itself its content, and this unity emerges as a work, as the

a. TheAbstractWorkofArt
705. The first work of art exists as immediate, abstract, and singular. For
itsownpart,ithastomoveitselffromthisimmediateandobjectivemode
into the contrary mode of self-consciousness, just as, on the other hand,
self-consciousness,whichisforitselfinthecult,aimsatsublatingthedif-
ferencewhichitinitiallygivesitselfcontrarytoitsownspirit,anditthereby
engendersaworkofartenliveningitselfinitsownself.
706.Thefirstmannerinwhichtheartisticspiritkeepsitsshapeandits
active consciousness at furthest remove from each other is the immediate
shape, so that the shape is there22 as a thing as such. – In itself, the shape
fallsapartintothedifferencebetweensingularindividuality,whichhasthe
shapeoftheselfinit,anduniversality,which,withreferencetotheshape,
exhibits the inorganic essence as its environs and dwelling. Through the
elevation of the whole into the pure concept, this shape attains its pure
form, which belongs to spirit. It is neither the crystal, which belonged to
the understanding and which houses the dead or which is illuminated by
the soul external to it, nor is it the mingling of the forms of nature and
of thought initially arising out of plants, whose activity is in here still an
imitation.Rather,theconceptstripsofftheroot,branches,andleavesstill

ships in such a way that the ensouling of the organic is incorporated into
the abstract form of understanding and, at the same time, its essence –
incommensurability–ispreservedfortheunderstanding.
707. However, the indwelling god is the black stone drawn out of its
animal encasing which is penetrated with the light of consciousness. The
379 human shape strips off the animal shape with which it was intermingled.
For the god, the animal is only a contingent disguise; the animal walks
alongside its true shape and no longer counts for itself as valid. Its mean-
ing has degenerated into that of something other, into a mere sign. As a
result, the shape of the god in its own self strips off even the neediness of
the natural conditions of animal existence, and it hints at those internal
preparations of organic life which are merged into its surface and which
belong only to this surface. – However, the essence of the god is the unity

of the universal existence of nature and of self-conscious spirit, which, in
itsactuality,appearsasconfrontingnature.Atthesametime,beingatfirst
a singular shape, its existence is one of the elements of nature just as its
self-conscious actuality is a singular spirit of a people. However, in this
unity, the former is the element which is reflected into spirit; it is nature
transfigured by thought and united with self-conscious life. For that rea-
son,theshapeofthegodshasitsnaturalelementasthatwhichissublated,

demandsthatthegodhaveanotherwayofcomingtolightotherthanthat

which is not that of universal self-consciousness. The oracle, both in the

been absolved from the form of contingent appearance, so in contrast in

716. This cult is only at first a secretcompletion, i.e., is only a
represented36 completion and not an actual one; it must be actual
action, for an non-actual action is self-contradictory. Authentic conscious-
ness elevates itself as a result into its pure self-consciousness. The essence
has within itself the significance of a free object, and through the actual
cult,theobjectrevertsbackintotheself–andtotheextentthattheobject
has in pure consciousness the significance of the pure essence dwelling in
an other-worldly realm beyond actuality, this essence descends through

For the self-conscious aspect, to the extent that it is actual consciousness,
theessenceexhibitsitselfasactualnature;ontheonehand,naturebelongs

actuality and singular individuality, which essence just as well regards as
non-essenceandassublated.Atthesametime,foritspureconsciousness,
that external nature signifies the opposite, namely, the essence existing-in-

what cannot be used and is instead the preparation of the offering for a
meal, the feast that cheats the action out of its negative significance. The
person making the offering reserves for his consumption the greatest share
from that first offering and what is useful from the latter offering. This
consumption is the negative power that sublates the essence as well as sin-
gular individuality, and this consumption is at the same time the positive

719.Incidentally,thiscultisindeedanactualaction,butitssignificance
lies for the most part only in devotion. What belongs to this devotion is
not objectively brought out, just as the result in consumption robs itself
of its existence. As a result, the cult goes further and, as a result, initially
replaces this defect by giving its devotion an objective stable existence, as
thecultisthecommonwork,ortheworkofeachandeverysingularindi-
vidual, which produces a dwelling and adornment for the honor of the
god. – As a result, the objectivity of the statuary column is in part sub-
lated,foritisthroughthisconsecrationofhisgiftsandhislaborsthatthe

the honor of the god which comes about, and the blessing of his favor
does not flow only in representational thought37 onto the worker. Rather,
the meaning of the work is also the converse of the first meaning, which
was that of self-relinquishing and of the honor rendered to that which is
alien. The dwellingsand halls of the godare for the use of man, the trea-

720. The people who approach their god in the cult of the art-religion
are an ethical people, who know their state and its actions as the will
and accomplishment of their own self. This spirit, confronting this self-
conscious people, is thus not the luminous essence, which, being selfless,
doesnotcontainthecertaintyofthesingularindividualwithinitselfbutis
instead only their universal essence and the dominating power in which
they disappear. What the religious cult of this simple shapeless essence
therefore gives back to those who belong to it is generally only that they
arethepeopleoftheirgod;thecultsecuresforthemonlytheirstableexis-
tence and their simple substance as such, but not their actual self, which
is instead repudiated, for they revere their god as empty depth but not
as spirit. However, the cult of the art-religion does without that former
abstract simplicity of essence, and it thus also does without its depth. But
the essence which is immediately at one with the self is in itself spirit and
theknowingtruth,38 althoughnotyettheknowntruth,orthetruthknow-

the god takes up residence in self-consciousness as its site. This site is for

722. In this consumption, that sunrise of the luminous essence is dis-
closed for what it is; it is the mystery of such consumption. This is so
because the mysticalis neither theconcealment ofasecret, nor is itigno-
rance. Rather, it consists in the self knowing itself to be at one with the
essence and the essence therefore being revealed. Only the self is revealed

singular individual knows at least how to play the part of a torchbearer,
still one of them stands out from the rest, he who is the shaped move-

He is an ensouled, living workof art, who pairs his beauty with strength,
and to whom, as the prize for his power, is accorded the adornment with
which the statuary column was honored; moreover, instead of the honor
due to the god set in stone, he is accorded the honor of being among his
388 peoplethehighestbodilyrepresentationoftheiressence.

730.Inthisepic,whatthuscomesaboutinitselfinthecult,therelation
of the divine to the human, presents itself as such to consciousness. The
content is an action of the essence conscious of itself. Acting disturbs the
rest of the substance and arouses it; it thereby divides its simplicity and
opensituptothediverseworldofnaturalandethicalforces.Theactionis
theviolationofthepeacefulearth;itisthetrenchensouledthroughblood,

versal endeavor, acquire two aspects, the self-like44 aspect, accomplished
bythetotalityofactualpeoplesalongwiththeindividualitieswhoarethe
heads, and the universal aspect accomplished by their substantial powers.
However, the relation between the two was previously determined so that
it is the synthetic combination of the universal and the singular, or is rep-
resentational thinking. It is on this determinateness that the assessment of
this world hangs. – The relationship between the two is, as a result, an
interminglingofbothofthem,arelationshipwhichinconsistentlydivides
the unity of the doing and which needlessly tosses the action from one
sidetotheother.Theuniversalpowershavetheshapeofindividualityand
thereby have in them the principle of acting; their having an effect hence
appears as a doing which originates wholly from out of them, an activity
which is equally as free as those originating from the people. Hence, one

by men. The seriousness of those former powers is a farcical superfluity,
sincethislatterisinfacttheforceoftheactingindividuality–whereasthe
effort and labor of the latter is again a useless effort, since it is the former
who direct everything. – The ephemeral mortals, who are nothing, are at
the same time the powerful self which brings into subjection the univer-
salessence,offendsthegods,providesactualityforthem,andprovidesthe
godswithaninterestindoingsomething;justas,conversely,thesepower-

731. Just as the gods fall into this contradictory relation with the self-
like nature confronting them, their universality just as much comes into
conflict with their own determination and its relations to others. They
are the eternal beautiful individuals, motionless in their own existence,
removed from all transience and from alien power. – However, they are
atthesametimedeterminateelements,particulargods,whostandinrela-

tionship to others is a battle with those others, a comic self-forgetfulness
about their own eternal nature. – That determinateness is rooted in the
stableexistenceofthedivine,andinitslimitationithastheself-sufficiency
of the whole individuality, through which their characters at the same
time lose the sharpness of their very distinctiveness, and in their multiple
meanings, they blend together with each other. – One purpose of activ-
ity, and their activity itself, since their activities are directed against an
other and, as a result, against an unconquerable divine force, is a contin-

success, and however much that former self-sufficient self-assurance out-
weighs that determinateness, as a result the pure force of the negative con-
fronts them as their final power, namely, as that against which they are
without recourse. They are the universal and the positive with regard to
thesingularselfofmortals,whichcannotholdoutagainsttheirpower,but
for that reason, the universal self, as the conceptless void of necessity, hovers
overthemandoverthiswholeworldofrepresentationalthoughttowhich
the entire content belongs – an event to which they relate selflessly and
in sorrow, for these determinate natures are not to be found within this
purity.
732. However, this necessity is the unity of the concept, which subju-

Both extremes must converge on the content; the one extreme, necessity,
has to suffuse itself with the content, and the other, the language of the
bard, must have a share in it; and the content which was formerly left to
itselfmustpreserveinitsownselfthecertaintyandthefixeddetermination
ofthenegative.
733. This higher language, that of tragedy, combines more closely the
dispersal of the moments of the essential world and the world of action.
According to the nature of the concept, the substance of the divine comes
undoneintoitsshapes,andtheirmovementislikewiseinconformitywith
the concept. With regard to form, language here ceases to be that of nar-
rative since it has entered into the content just as the content has ceased
to be that of representational thought. The hero is himself the speaker,
andtheperformance47 showsthelistener,whoisatthesametimealsoan
onlooker,self-consciouspeoplewhoknowtheirownrightsandpurposes,the
power and the will of their determinateness, and who know how to state
those things. They are artists who do not express unconsciously, naively,
and naturally what is external to their decisions and commencements, as
is the case in the language which accompanies ordinary doings in actual
life. Rather, they express the inner essence, they demonstrate the right of
their action, and the pathos to which they belong is reflectively asserted
and determinately expressed in its universal individuality, free from con-
tingentcircumstancesandtheparticularitiesofpersonalities.Finally,these
characters exist as actual people who take on the personae of the heroes
and exhibit it to them in actual speech, not as a narrative, but in their
own words. Just as it is essential for a statuary column to be made by
humanhands,theactorislikewiseessentialtohismask–notasanexternal

essencewithinitself.
735. On the basis of this spectatorial consciousness as the indifferent
soil of representational thinking, spirit does not come on the scene in its
dispersed multiplicity but rather in the simple estrangement of the con-
cept. Its substance thus shows itself only as ripped asunder into its two
extreme powers. These elemental universal essences are at the same time
self-conscious individualities – heroes who put their conscious life into
one of these powers, who have in these powers their determinateness of
character, and who constitute the activity and actuality of these
(CC)Religion 423
powers. – This universal individualization descends again, as will be
remembered,totheimmediateactualityofrealexistenceandpresentsitself

insteadhaveinittheirownperformance48 givingvoicetoitself.
736. The content and movement of spirit, which is here an object to
itself,hasbeenalreadyexaminedasthenatureandrealizationoftheethi-
cal substance. In its religion, spirit attains a consciousness about itself, or
itputsitselfbeforeitsconsciousnessinitspurerformanditssimplerfigu-

and according to its content, has estranged itself into two powers, which

was that of state power – the first was the feminine, the other the mascu-
linecharacter–stillthepreviouslymultiplyformedcircleofgods,wherein
each wavered in their determinations, limits itself to these powers, which
through this determination are brought nearer to genuine individuality.
This is so because the previous dispersal of the whole into multiple and

higher and lower law continue to mean are the power which knows and
which reveals itself to consciousness and the power which conceals itself
and lies in ambush. The one is the aspect of light, the god of the oracle,
which, according to its natural moment, has sprung forth from the all-
illuminating sun, who knows all and reveals all – Phoebus and Zeus, who
is his father. However, the commands of this truth-speaking god, along

with his proclamations about what is, are instead deceptive, for within
its concept, this knowing is immediately not-knowing, because in acting,
consciousness is in itself this opposition. He who had the power to unlock
the riddle of the sphinx itself, trustingly, as with childlike confidence, is
sent to ruin through what the god reveals to him. This priestess through
whom the beautiful god speaks is none other than the ambiguous49 sis-
ters of fate, who, by their promises, drive the one who trusted them into
crime,andwho,bythetwo-facedcharacterofwhattheygaveoutasacer-

universality, that it portions itself out into two individual shapes. For the
self of the hero only has existence as a whole consciousness and hence is
essentially the whole difference which belongs to the form, but the hero’s
substance is determinate, and only one side of the difference of content
belongstohim.Hence,ofthetwoaspectsofconsciousness,whichinactu-
ality have no separate individuality belonging to each on its own, each
receives in representational thought its own particular shape – the one is
thatoftherevealedgod,theotheristhatoftheself-concealingErinyes.In
part,bothenjoyequalhonor,butinpart,theshapeofthesubstance,Zeus,
is the necessity of the relation of both to each other. The substance is the
relation, that knowing is for itself, but it has its truth in the simple; and
that the difference, through which actual consciousness is, has its ground
intheinneressencewhichiserasingit;andbecausetheself-clearconscious
assuranceofcertaintyhasitsconfirmationinforgetfulness.
740. Consciousness unlocked this opposition by acting. In acting
according to revealed knowing, it experiences the deceptiveness of that
knowing,accordingtothecontent;insubmittingtooneoftheattributesof

thedream,andsoon,arenotthewaysinwhichtruthappears;rather,they
arewarningsignsofdeception,ofnotbeingreflectivelyprudent,ofthesin-
gularity and the contingency of knowing. Or, what amounts to the same
thing, the opposite power, which consciousness has violated, is present as
declared law and the legality validly in force, whether it be the law of the
family or that of the state; consciousness, on the other hand, pursued its
own knowing and hid from itself what was revealed. However, the truth
of those powers emerging into opposition with each other is the result of

individualities and of the powers of the abstract thought of good and
evil, for none of them is for itself the essence. Rather, the essence is the
motionlessness of the whole within itself, the unmoved unity of Fate,
motionless existence, and thereby the inactivity and lack of liveliness of
the family and government; and it is the equal honor and thereby the
indifferentirreality52 ofApolloandtheErinyes,andthereversionoftheir
spiritualization53 andactivityintosimpleZeus.
741. This fate completes the depopulation of heaven, of that intermin-
gling of individuality and essence which is devoid of thought – an inter-
minglingthroughwhichthisessence’sdoingappearsasinconsistent,con-
tingent, and unworthy of itself. For individuality, when it adheres itself
only superficially to essence, is inessential individuality. The expulsion of
such essenceless representational thoughts, something demanded by the
philosophersofantiquity,thusalreadybeginsintragedyitselfbecausethe
division of the substance is dominated by the concept, individuality is
thereby essential individuality, and the determinations are the absolute
characters. The self-consciousness represented in tragedy knows and rec-
ognizes on that account only one highest power. This Zeus is known and
recognizedonlyasthepowerofthestateorofthehearthandhome,and,
intheoppositionofknowing,onlyasthefatheroftheknowingofthepar-
ticular, a knowing that is coming to assume a shape – and as the Zeus of
the oath and of the Erinyes, the Zeus of the universal, of the inner which

simple certainty of itself, is in fact the negative power, the unity of Zeus,
the unity of the substantial essence and abstract necessity; it is the spiri-
tualunityintowhicheverythingreturns.Becauseactualself-consciousness
is still distinguished both from substance and from fate, it is in part the
chorus, or rather is instead the crowd looking on, which this movement
of the divine life as something alien suffuses with fear, or in which this
movement,assomethingclosetothem,astouchingthem,bringsforthan
inactive compassion. Partly to the extent that consciousness acts in unison
with the characters and belongs to them, is this union an external one,
because the true union, namely, that of self, fate, and substance, is not
yet present and available. This union is thus hypocrisy, and the hero who
appears before the spectators fragments into both his mask and into the
actor,intothepersona54 andtheactualself.

consciousness exhibiting itself as the fate of the gods. These elemental

which it shows not to be distinct from the authentic self, from the actor,
norevenfromthespectator.
745. This universal dissolution of shaped essentiality itself in its indi-
viduality becomes more serious in its content and as a result more wan-

As a result, spirit is thus equally consciousness of itself as its objective sub-
stancejustasitissimpleself-consciousnesswhichendureswithinitself.
750. The art-religion belongs to the ethical spirit, which we saw earlier
cometoanendinthestateoflegality,i.e.,intheproposition:Theselfassuch,
theabstractperson,isabsoluteessence.Inethicallife,theselfisimmersedin
thespiritofitspeople;itisuniversalityfilledout.However,simplesingular

andconfersonthespiritlessself,onthesingularperson,being-in-and-for-
itself.
751. However, through its emptiness, this self has set the content free;
consciousness is only within itself the essence; its own existence, the legal
recognition of the person, is the unfulfilled abstraction. Therefore, it
instead possesses only the thought of itself, or in the way it is there and
knows itself as object, it is the non-actual self. Hence, it is only the stoic
self-sufficiency of thinking, and as it passes through the movement of the
skeptical consciousness, it finds its truth in the shape that was called the
unhappyself-consciousness.
752. This self knows the story about what actually counts concerning
the abstract person; it likewise also knows the story about what counts
concerning the person in pure thought. It knows that what this amounts
to is instead a complete loss; it is itself this loss which has become con-
sciousofitself,anditistheself-relinquishingofitsknowingofitself.–We
now see that the unhappy consciousness constituted the counterpart and

753. In the state of legality, therefore, the ethical world and its reli-
gion have been absorbed into the comic consciousness, and the unhappy
consciousness is the knowing of this entire loss. Lost to it are both the 402
self-worth of its immediate personality as well as that of its mediated,

755. Spirit has two aspects in it, which are represented above as two
converse propositions. One is this, that substance relinquishes itself of its
ownselfandbecomesself-consciousness;theother,conversely,isthatself-
consciousness empties itself of itself and makes itself into thinghood, or
into the universal self. Both aspects have in this way accommodated each
other, and their true union has thereby arisen. The self-relinquishing of
substance, its becoming self-consciousness, expresses the transition into
the opposite, into unconscious necessity, or, it expresses that it is in itself
self-consciousness.Conversely,theself-relinquishingofself-consciousness
expresses this, that self-consciousness is in itself the universal essence, or,
because the self is pure being-for-itself, which in its opposite remains at
one with itself,64 it expresses this, that the substance is self-consciousness
and,preciselyasaresult,isspirit.Hence,itcanbesaidofthisspiritwhich
hasforsakentheshapeofsubstanceandenteredintoexistenceintheshape
of self-consciousness – if one wishes to use the relationships drawn from
the process of natural generation – that it has an actual mother but a
father who exists-in-itself, for actuality, or self-consciousness, and the in-
itself, as substance, are both of its moments, and through their reciprocal

itself and become self-consciousness, for all existence is spiritual essence
only from the standpoint of consciousness and not in itself. With regard to
existence, spirit is in this manner only imaginary; this imagination is that
gushing enthusiasm that reads into nature as well as into history, just as it
also reads into the world and into the mythical representational thoughts
of the preceding religions, a different inward sense from what they, from
within their own appearance, immediately offer to consciousness, and, in
the case of those religions, it reads into them a different sense than the
self-consciousnesswhosereligionstheywereactuallyknewinthem.How-
ever, this meaning is one that is borrowed, a garment that does not cover
thenakednessoftheappearanceandthatwarrantsneitherbeliefnorven-
eration. Rather, it remains the murky night of consciousness, the rapture
propertoconsciousness.
757. If therefore this latter meaning of the objective is not to be mere
imagination,itmustbeinitself,whichistosay,forconsciousnessitmust
first of all have its source in theconcept and must emerge in its necessity.
In that way, self-knowing spirit has arisen for us through the cognition
of immediate consciousness, or of the consciousness of the existing object
through its necessary movement. This concept, which, as the immediate
concept,alsohadtheshapeofimmediacyforitsconsciousness,has,secondly,
given itself the shape of self-consciousness in itself, i.e., precisely accord-
ing to the necessity of the concept by which being, or immediacy, which
is the contentless object of sensuous consciousness, relinquishes itself of
itself and, for consciousness, becomes the I. – The immediate in-itself, or
theexistingnecessityitself,is,however,differentiatedfromthethinkingin-
itself, or thecognizing of necessity – a difference which at the same time,
however, does not lie outside of the concept, for the simple unity of the
concept is immediate being itself. The concept is precisely that which is
self-relinquishing, or it is the coming-to-be of intuited necessity as it is at
onewithitselfinthatnecessity,anditknowsitandconceptuallycompre-
hendsit.–Theimmediatein-itselfofspirit,whichgivesitselftheshapeof

758. This, that absolute spirit has given itself the shape of self-
consciousness in itself and thereby also for its consciousness, now appears
in the following way. The faith of the world is that spirit is there as a self-

The gracious, the righteous, the holy, creator of heaven and earth, etc.,
are predicates of a subject – universal moments that have their foothold
in this point and only are in the return of consciousness into thinking. –
406 While they are known, their ground and essence, the subject itself, is not
yet revealed, and, likewise, the determinations of the universal are not this
universal itself. However, the subject itself, and thereby also this pure uni-

it becomes itself spiritual consciousness, or just as he previously arose as
408 sensuous existence for consciousness, he has now arisen in spirit. – For,
as the sort that sensuously sees and hears him, consciousness is itself only
immediate consciousness which has not sublated the inequality of objec-
tivity, has not withdrawn itself into pure thinking, but rather knows this
objective singular individual but not itself as spirit. In the disappearance

Its truth is to become the actual self, to reflect itself into itself and to be
the subject. This is therefore the movement which spirit accomplishes in
its religious community, or this is its life. What this self-revealing spirit
is in and for itself is therefore not brought out by having, so to speak, its

spirit only according to empty words if it were to remain in representa-
tional thought and in the expression of simple eternal essence. However,
because it is an abstraction, simple essence is in fact the negative in itself;
indeed, it is the negativity of thinking, or negativity of thought as it is in
itself in the essence, i.e., it is the absolute difference from itself, or it is its
purebecoming-other.Asessence,itisonlyinitself,orforus,butwhilethis

770. There are therefore three moments to be distinguished: Essence;
being-for-itself that is the otherness of essence and for which essence is;
and being-for-itself that is self-knowing in an other. The essence intuits
onlyitselfinitsbeing-for-itself;inthisself-relinquishing,itisonlyatone
with itself,74 is the being-for-itself which excludes itself from the essence,
is the essence’s knowing of itself; it is the word, which, when spoken, relin-
quishes the speaker and leaves him behind as emptied and hollowed out,
butwhichislikewiseimmediatelyinterrogated,anditisonlythishearing-
and-interrogating-of-itself that is the existence of the word. In that way,
the differences which are rendered are likewise immediately dissolved as
they are rendered, and they are equally immediately rendered just as they
are dissolved, andthe true and the actualare this very movement circling
aroundwithinitself.

772. Absolute spirit, represented in the pure essence, is indeed not the
abstract pure essence. Rather, as a result of its being only a moment in
spirit,theabstractpureessencehasinsteaddeclinedintoanelement.How-
ever, the exhibition of spirit in this element has, according to the form,
in itself the same defect that the essence has as essence. The essence is the
abstract,andforthatreasonitisthenegativeofitssimplicity,isanother.
Likewise,spiritintheelementofessenceistheformofsimpleunity,which
for that reason is equally essentially a coming-to-be-other. – Or, what is
the same thing, the relation of the eternal essence to its being-for-itself is
the immediately-simple relation of pure thinking; in this simple intuiting
of itself in the other, otherness therefore is not posited as such. It is the
difference as it is in pure thinking, which is to be immediately no differ-
ence,orarecognitionoflove,inwhichbothare,accordingtotheiressence,
not opposed to each other. – Spirit, which is expressed in the element of
pure thinking, is essentially itself just this, that it is does not exist only
in pure thinking; it is also actual, for lying in the concept of spirit is oth-
erness itself, i.e., the sublation of the pure concept which has only been
thought.77

774. Therefore, the merely eternal or abstract spirit becomes an other 412
to itself, or it enters into existence and immediately into immediate exis-
tence.Itthereforecreatesaworld.Thiscreatingisrepresentationalthought’s
word for the concept itself according to its absolute movement, or it is its
wordforthesimplicitywhichhasbeenexpressedastheabsolute,oraspure

yet another form, because what is posited as essence is simple immediacy,
orbeing,butwhichasimmediacy,orasbeing,dispenseswiththeselfand
therefore lacks inwardness and is passive, or is being for an other. – This
being for an other is at the same time a world. Spirit in the determination
of being for an other, is the motionless stable existence of those moments
whichwereformerlyenclosedinpurethinking,anditisthereforethedis-
solution of their simple universality and their splitting up into their own
particularity.
775. However, the world is not only spirit thus thrown and dispersed
into completeness and its external order. Rather, since spirit is essentially
the simple self, this self is likewise present in the world. It is the existing
spirit which is the singular individual self which is both conscious and
which distinguishes itself from itself as an other, or as a world. – Just as

butnot,however,good.Foritinfacttobetheselfandtobespirit,itmust
just as much become an other to itself, just as the eternal essence exhibits
itself as the movement of being equal to itself in its otherness. While this
spirit is determined initially as immediately existent, or as dispersed into
the manifoldness of its consciousness, its coming-to-be-other is knowing
taking-the-inward-turn. Immediate existence is converted into thought,
or consciousness that is only sensuous is converted into consciousness of

their relationship to each other. – To the extent that immediate existence

happens that just as evil is nothing but the inward-turn of the natural
existenceofspirit,soconverselythegoodentersintoactualityandappears
as an existing self-consciousness. – What in the purely conceived78 spirit
is only intimated as the coming-to-be-the-other of the divine essence here
comes closer to its realization for representational thinking. To represen-
tational thinking, the coming-to-be-the-other of the divine essence consists
in the divine essence humbling itself and renouncing its abstraction and
non-actuality.–Theotheraspect,thatofevil,istakenbyrepresentational
thinking to be an event alien to the divine essence. To grasp evil in the
divine essence itself as the divine essence’s wrath is the supreme and most
severe effort of which representational thinking, wrestling with itself, is
capable; an effort which, since it lacks the concept, remains a fruitless
struggle.
778. The alienation of the divine essence is therefore posited in its
twofold mode. The self of spirit and its simple thought are the two
momentswhoseabsoluteunityisspirititself.Itsalienationconsistsinthe
twomomentsseparatingthemselvesfromeachother,andinonehavingan
unequal value with regard to the other. This inequality is for that reason
twofold,andtwocombinationsemerge,whosecommonmomentsarethe

natural existence and the self as the inessential, as something to be sub-
lated.Ontheotherhand,intheother,itisbeing-for-itselfwhichcountsas

separateandself-sufficientessences.Whatliesintheirself-sufficiencyisthat
in itself each must in its own self, through its concept, dissolve itself. The
struggle initially begins where both cease to be this mixture of thought
and self-sufficient existence and where they confront each other only as
thoughts, for, as determinate concepts, they essentially are only in that
oppositionalrelation.Incontrast,asself-sufficientconcepts,theyhavetheir
essentiality outside of their opposition; their movement is therefore free

both is therefore the movement in itself because the movement of both is
to be observed in them, so it is that the movement also begins in the one
which is determined as existing-in-itself in contrast to the other. This is

essential moment of the self of spirit. – That this inwardly-turned-being,
which is thereby actuality, belongs to the essence itself, this latter, which
for us is theconcept and to the extent that it is a concept, appears to rep-
resentationally thinking consciousness as an incomprehensible occurrence;
and to representational thinking, the in-itself takes on the form of indif-
ferent being. However, the thought that these moments which seem to be
in flight from each other are in fact not separated, namely, the moments
of absolute essence and of the self existing-for-itself, also appears to this
representational thinking– for it does possess the true content – but this

781. Spirit is therefore posited in the third element, in universal self-
consciousness;spiritisitsreligiouscommunity.Themovementofthisreli-

self-consciousness; He has to become this for this latter self-consciousness.
Or, while this self-consciousness constitutes one side of the opposition in

783.Howevermuchthereforeinrepresentationallythinkingconscious-
ness the inwardizing82 of natural self-consciousness was existing evil, still
the inwardization in the element of self-consciousness is the knowing of 418
evil as what is in itself in existence. Thus, this knowing is admittedly a
coming-to-beofevil,butitisonlythecoming-to-beofthethoughtofevil
and is for that reason given recognition as the first moment of reconcil-
iation; for, as a return into itself from out of the immediacy of nature,
which is determined as what is evil, it is the forsaking of that immediacy
and to die unto sin. It is not natural existence as such that consciousness
forsakes but the natural existence that is at the same time known as evil.

784. Therefore, other than this immediacy, the mediation of represen-
tational thought is necessary. Both the knowing of nature as the untrue
existence ofspirit andthisuniversality ofselfwhichhas takentheinward
turn are each in themselves the reconciliation of spirit with itself. For
the non-conceptually comprehending self-consciousness,83 this in-itself
receivesboththeformofanexistentandtheformofsomethingrepresented
toit.Therefore,tothatself-consciousness,conceptuallygraspingthemat-
ter does not consist in getting a grip on this concept, which knows sub-
latednaturalexistencetobeuniversalandthustobereconciledwithitself.
Rather, it consists in getting a grip on the representational thought that
thedivineessenceisreconciledwithitsexistencethroughtheeventofthe
divineessence’sownrelinquishingofitself,throughitsincarnationwhich
has already occurred and its death. – To get a grip on this representation

gularself-consciousnesscomingtobetheuniversal,oritscomingtobethe

negativity, the immediate result of the movement which only comes to
an end in natural universality. In spiritual self-consciousness, death loses
thisnaturalsignificance,oritbecomesitsalreadystatedconcept.Deathis
transfigured from what it immediately means, i.e., from the non-being of
thissingularindividual,intotheuniversality ofspiritwhichlivesinitsown
religiouscommunity,diestheredaily,andisdailythereresurrected.
785. What belongs to the element of representational thought, abso-
lute spirit representing the nature of spirit in its existence as a singular
spirit or instead as a particular spirit, is therefore shifted here into self-
consciousness itself, into the knowing that sustains itself in its otherness.
This self-consciousness thus does not therefore actually die off in the way
419 that the particular is represented to have actually died; rather, its particu-
laritydiesoffinitsuniversality,whichistosay,initsknowing,whichisthe
essence reconciling itself with itself. That initially antecedent element of
representational thinking is therefore posited here as sublated, or it has
returned into the self, into its concept; what was only an existent in the
former has become the subject. – precisely by doing so, the first element,

What dies is not only the already dead outer shell stripped of essence but
alsotheabstractionofthedivineessence,forthemediatoris,totheextent
that his death has not yet completed the reconciliation, one-sided, which
as one-sided knows the simplicity of thinking as the essence in opposition

them all into itself. Spirit certain of itself in its existence has as the ele-
ment of its existence nothing but this knowing of itself: Nothing but its
expression that what it does, it does out of the conviction of duty, and
that this, its language, is what makes its acting count as valid. – Acting is
boththefirstdivisionexisting-in-itselfofthesimplicityoftheconceptand
the return from out of this division. This first movement rolls over into
the second, while the element of recognition posits itself as simple know-
ing of duty in contrast to thedifference and the estrangement which lie in
action as such, and, in this manner, it forms an ironclad actuality con-
fronting action. However, in forgiveness we saw how this hardness itself

finally sublate the empty opposition which still remains, and they are the

794. This reconciliation of consciousness with self-consciousness is
thereby shown to have been brought about from two sides; at one time
in the religious spirit and again in consciousness itself as such. They are
differentiated from each other in that the former is this reconciliation in
theformofbeing-in-itself,thelatterintheformofbeing-for-itself.Asthey

isnotavailableasfelttruth,astheeternalwhichisinwardlyrevealed,asthe
holy which is the object of faith, or whatever expressions are otherwise

the object of consciousness. However, this substance, which is spirit, is its
coming-to-bewhatit,thesubstance,isinitself;anditisasthiscoming-to-
be which is taking a reflective turn into itself that spirit is truly in itself
spirit. Spirit is in itself the movement which is cognition – the transfor-
mation of that former in-itself into for-itself, ofsubstance into subject, of
the object of consciousness into the object of self-consciousness, i.e., into an
object that is just as much sublated, or into the concept. This transforma-

it is thus differentiated into its intuited pure concept, into time, and into

inward necessity of exhibiting itself in its own self as what it is in itself,14
as spirit. The completed objective exhibition is at the same time only the
reflection of substance, or substance becoming the self. – Hence, as long

it cannot attain its completion as self-conscious spirit. For that reason, the

speak of a content, such content would still be, on the one hand, spoken
of only in order to cast it into the empty abyss of the absolute content,
while on the other hand, it would be externally gathered up from out of
sensuous perception. Knowing would seem to have arrived at things, at
whatisdifferentfromitself,andatthedifferencesamongmultiplethings
without having conceptually grasped how it got there or from where it
came.

likewise,assubject,hasbothtakentheinwardturnintoitselffromoutof
that substance and has made its substance into an object and a content,
justasithassublatedthisdifferencebetweenobjectivityandcontent.That
first reflection from out of immediacy is the subject’s differentiating itself
fromitssubstance,oritistheconceptestrangingitself,taking-the-inward-

puredoingofthe“I=I,”theconceptisboththenecessityandthesunrise

and as what is existing-in and existing-for-itself, being-for-itself is equally
as well only to be posited as a moment just like being-in-itself. – Nor is
the I a mediating third, which tosses the differences back into the abyss
of the absolute difference and in this abyss declares them all to be equal.
On the contrary, knowing consists in this seeming inactivity which only
examines how the differentiated in its own self moves itself and how it
returnsbackintoitsunity.
805.Therefore,inthisknowing,spirithasbroughttoaclosethemove-
mentofgivingshapetoitselfinasmuchasthatmovementisburdenedwith
the insurmountable differences of consciousness. Spirit has won the pure 432
elementofitsexistence,theconcept.Accordingtothefreedomofitsbeing,
the content is the self relinquishing itself of itself, or it is the immediate
unity of self-knowing. Considered with regard to the content, the pure
movement of this self-relinquishing constitutes the necessity of this con-
tent.Thediversityofcontentisasdeterminatecontentinsetsofrelations,

thecontentistheconcept.Whilethereforespirithasattainedtheconcept,
it unfolds existence and movement in this ether of its life, and it is sci-
ence. The moments of its movement no longer exhibit themselves in that
movementasdeterminateshapesofconsciousness;rather,asthedifferencein

determinate concepts and as the organic self-grounded movement of these

trast,containthisdifferenceanditssublation.Rather,asthemomenthas
the form of the concept, it unites the objective form of truth and that of
the knowing self into an immediate unity. The moment does not come
on the scene as this movement of passing to and fro from consciousness,
or from representational thought, into self-consciousness and then back
again; rather, the pure shape liberated from its appearance in conscious-
ness,thepureconceptanditsfurtherforwardmovement,dependsolelyon
its pure determinateness. Conversely, to every abstract moment of science,

its simple mediation as thinking, breaks up and separates the moments of
thismediationandexhibitsitselfaccordingtotheirinneropposition.
806. Science contains within itself this necessity to relinquish itself of
the form of the pure concept and to make the transition from the con-
cept into consciousness. For self-knowing spirit, just for the reason that it
grasps its own concept, is an immediate equality with itself, which in its
differencesisthecertaintyoftheimmediate,orissensuousconsciousness –the
beginningfromwhichwestarted.Thisreleaseofitselffromtheformofits
ownselfisthehighestfreedomandthehighestassuranceofitsknowingof
itself.
433 807. Nonetheless, this relinquishing is still incomplete. It expresses the
relationofself-certaintytotheobject,anobjectwhich,justbybeinginthe
relation, has not yet attained its full freedom. Knowing is acquainted not
only with itself, but also with the negative of itself, or its limit. To know
its limit means to know that it is to sacrifice itself. This sacrifice is the
relinquishing in which spirit exhibits its coming-to-be spirit in the form
ofafreecontingentevent,anditintuitsoutsideofitselfitspureselfastime
and likewise intuits its being as space. This final coming-to-be, nature, is
itsliving,immediatecoming-to-be.Nature,orrelinquishedspirit,isinits
existence nothing but this eternal relinquishing of its stable existence and
themovementwhichproducesthesubject.
808. However, the other aspect of spirit’s coming-to-be, history, is that
knowing self-mediating coming-to-be – the spirit relinquished into time.
However,thisrelinquishingislikewisetherelinquishingofitself;theneg-
ative is the negative of itself. This coming-to-be exhibits a languid move-
mentandsuccessionofspirits,agalleryofpictures,ofwhicheach,endowed
with the entire wealth of spirit, moves itself so slowly because the self has
to take hold of and assimilate the whole of this wealth of its substance.
Whileitsconsummationconsistsinspirit’scompletelyknowingwhatitis,
in spirit knowing its substance, this knowing is its taking-the-inward-turn
in which spirit forsakes its existence and gives its shape over to recollec-
tion.Intaking-the-inward-turn,spiritisabsorbedintothenightofitsself-
consciousness, but its vanished existence is preserved in that night, and
thissublatedexistence–theexistencewhichwaspriorbutisnownewborn
from knowing – is the new existence, a new world, and a new shape of
spirit. In that new shape of spirit, it likewise has to begin all over again
withoutprejudiceinitsimmediacy,and,fromitsimmediacy,torearitself
again to maturity, as if all that had preceded it were lost to it and as if it
weretohavelearnednothingfromtheexperienceoftheprecedingspirits.
(DD)AbsoluteKnowing 467
However, that inwardizing re-collection18 has preserved that experience; it
is what is inner, and it is in fact the higher form of substance. However
much therefore this spirit begins its cultural formation and education all
over again and seems to start only from itself, still it is at the same time
makingitsbeginningatahigherlevel.Therealmofspirits,havingformed
itself in this way in existence, constitutes a sequence in which one spirit
replaced the other, and each succeeding spirit took over from the previ-
ous spirit the realm of that spirit’s world. The goal of the movement is
the revelation of depth itself, and this is the absolute concept. This revela-
tion is thereby the sublation of its depth, or its extension, the negativity
of this I existing-inwardly-in-itself,19 which is its self-relinquishing, or its
substance – and is its time. In its own self, this self-relinquishing relin-
quishes itself and, in that way, is in its extension as well as in its depth,
in the self. The aim, absolute knowing, or spirit knowing itself as spirit,
has its path in the recollection of spirits as they are in themselves and are 434

Hegel’s Advertisement and Hegel’s Note to Himself
The following is an advertisement for the Phenomenology which was run
originally in the Bamberger Zeitung in July 1807 and was almost certainly
written by Hegel himself. Later, the advertisement also appeared in some
otherliteraryjournalsinGermany.
The publishing company of Jos. Ant. Goebhardt in Bamberg and
Würzburg has now published the following book, which is available in
allgoodbookstores:

stations on the way through which spirit becomes pure knowledge, that
is, absolute spirit. Consequently, the principal sections of this science are
examinedintermsofthefollowingdivisions,whichthemselvesaredivided
into even more sections: consciousness, self-consciousness, observing and
acting reason, spirit itself as ethical, as culturally maturing, and as moral
spirit, and finally as religious spirit in its distinct forms. The wealth of
