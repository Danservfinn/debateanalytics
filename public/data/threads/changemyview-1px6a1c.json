Why did it suddenly rocket into popularity?\n\n\nLet me break it down: \n\nFor the longest time beef fat was just a byproduct that nobody wanted. Steaks were trimmed, roasts were rejected for being \u201ctoo fatty\u201d, heck, even the most popular version of ground beef is 80/20. Butchers and manufacturers couldn\u2019t even give it away due to lack of demand. This was unacceptable! Big Beef can\u2019t wring out every cent from consumers if they\u2019re just throwing things away. Rising meat prices just weren\u2019t enough to pad shareholders pockets. \n\nBut someone, somewhere, got smart. \n\nSuddenly it\u2019s repackaged as \u201cbeef tallow\u201d and consumers can\u2019t get enough! Beef tallow for cooking! Frying! Even skincare! The all natural solution to your every need! The word of beef tallow stretches into every genre of influencers online: cooking, homesteaders, trad-wives and beauty influencers alike tout this \u201corganic miracle\u201d on the algorithms of the general public. Now, not only is there purpose, but demand for discarded beef fat! I mean, all organic beef tallow. Actually, since it\u2019s healthy and trendy let\u2019s go ahead in charge 9-12 dollars a jar! \n\nSo my theory is that Big Beef is doing what all companies do. Find and manipulate different ways of capturing the consumer in an increasingly convoluted market. Bonus points if you can use something you already had on hand, market it into something new and shiny, and infiltrate the social media sphere to push the word out. \n\nSigned- a marketing student. \n\nEDIT: Thank you all! My view has been changed, and I think I simply gave Big Beef too much credit as market manipulators \ud83d\ude02. ",

Usually have eggs, some cheese, and milk alternatives since my intolerant. And the only other animal products I consume on a weekly basis is salmon or some type of fish. The rest is all plant based. \n\nIm pretty into fitness and weightlifting too, but everyone in that space pushes this same stupid narrative. They always think that eating red meat, butter (or other animal fats), and raw milk will make you a \"wild beast\" or help you \"ascend\" or some stupid shit like that. And the whole primal lifestyle claims are one i see a lot too.\n Like first off, drinking animal milk basically means youre trying to act like a baby, since many wild animals only drink milk as babies. And what wild beasts eat butter and cheese lol? From what i understand all those wild animals are designed to digest animal based foods much better than humans, but these guys always say \"it doesnt matter if their not humans\" but im pretty sure it does.\n\nAnother funny thing i see is how they claim they wanna be like a \"viking\" or a \"spartan\". This always makes me die of laughter... and i quoted it because what they do today isnt what those 2 would do back then. They literally ate so much plant matter back then and ate a ton of grains, or what they would frame as \"goy slop\"... whatever the hell that even means. Didn't vikings literally try to find somewhere to settle because they a wanted to grow wheat so badly? \n\nIm definitely no expert, but ive tried questioning the influencers i see on social media and whenever I argue with them the always rely off of anecdotes, insults, or just avoiding the question. And when i ask them for proof on some of their claims they just say \"studies dont proof anything\". And there's an endless supply of these guys and girls online. Especially on ig. Theres a whole ass group called \"the carnivore cult\" and its filled with youre average Joes and Jolenes with pages dedicated to spreading carnivore and all that.\n\n Something ive seen more recently is that they'll force the diet onto their families too. I've seen this lady that makes her athletes kids eat a keto diet, and my mom knows someone on her fb that makes her whole family eat carnivore too. This lady had an autoimmune and claimed carnivore cured it. My mom understands this because she has autoimmunes too and tried keto back then, but it didnt do as much as she thought it would. She's showed me the lady I mentioned and her kids look awfully skinny and unhealthy. Its only fair I give a direct example of an influencer like this, but these accounts are so small, there's so many of them, and i dont wanna spread negativity directly towards their socials. So an example i could give is goatis. A lotta people know him and these people i see remind me of him. Ya know... the odd claims... the rejection of studies and science, and the conspiracies.",

It is dead cheap, because it is litterally lard.\n\nNow the reason to sell tallow is because not every single person on this earth has the will or time to boil down 20 pounds of beef fat and stink up there whole house. Its for ease of access and you are charged for the process of making it. Hence why it actually costs some money as oppose to beef fat. \n\nNow you are right about the big boom of beef tallow fads such as skin care. \n\nBut in all honestly tallow is a great tool for cooking and baking.
