## POST BODY
----------------------------------------
The title already says most of it. We’re in early pregnancy and are trying to decide if the missus should get her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine while she’s still in the first trimester. 

We’re UK based, are both working from home and not seeing many people socially at the moment and can continue to do so until we hit the 12 week mark. So our risk of exposure to covid is relatively low. 

Main concerns with the vaccine is the impact of a fever as a side effect of the vaccine. To a lesser extent there is also the concern of little research into the effects of the vaccine on an early foetus. 

So, that’s our current risk / reward calculus. Change my view.

Edit: Yes, we’ve talked to a doctor. They essentially outlined the same risk / rewards I’ve outlined above. I’ve seen some high quality discussion and research on this sub so I thought I’d see what it turned up.

Edit 2: If your answer is “talk to a doctor” I’ve answered that below and won’t be engaging with it further. If you have a good argument backed by statistics and/or medical research please contribute.

Edit 3: Just to be super super clear. The doctor did not conclusively recommend she got the vaccine. He outlined the risks in both directions and said the decision was up to us.

Is it not possible to have a civil discussion about this? My opinion of this sub is rapidly deteriorating.

Final Edit: After some more discussion between ourselves we’ve decided to bring forward her vaccination to just after the 6 week mark. Greater exposure to risk when going to medicinal appointments was the compelling argument. 

But those of you who answered stating I was being irresponsible, or worse actively trying to kill my wife and child, should be ashamed of yourselves. We’re very pro vaccine, but there are unknown risks associated with early pregnancy. The visceral response I got from some people made me begin to actually understand anti-vaxers a little. That level of attack (with under informed arguments in most cases) rarely does anything but cause a person to more strongly cling to the belief you are arguing against. If you really want to convince more people to get vaccines spend a little more time trying to understand human psychology and less being a keyboard warrior on Reddit.

If a literal doctor that has better knowledge both in terms of the specific patient, on the directives given by research experts in his jurisdiction and the possible risks involved with the specific vaccine couldn't change your view, what would it take for us to change it?

### Comment #3 | u/smcarre | Score: 107 | Depth: 4

That's not really important, what's important is that the doctor you spoke to had access to all the necessary information he could have needed to make his recommendation and it was for your wife to get the vaccine.

Here we don't have the same access to resources that this doctor had and such won't be able to make an informed (or at least as informed as your doctor's) argument, regardless how much time we have to formulate it and explain it to you.

EDIT: also forgot to mention that due to the anonymity of Reddit it will be unlikely that you can verify the credentials of anyone making any other recommendation here, different to your doctor whose credentials you can verify and be sure that the person making the recommendation is someone that studied and practiced for years to make those recommendations and not a random person on the internet that has the same basic medical knowledge as everyone else.

Info: when did she have her first dose? And when was it in relation to her finding out she was pregnant? 

The most recent data seems to suggest that the ‘sweet spot’ in terms of gap between Pfizer vaccines is 8 weeks. A longer gap is still effective, but does not seem to be as effective in providing protection against the delta variant. 

If it’s possible your wife had her first jab while pregnant then it would seem on balance that you aren’t really reducing any potential and unsubstantiated risk to your unborn child. 

On the other hand recent data reports that around 170 women had to be hospitalised for COVID on the past three months, and none were double jabbed. The potential risks linked to an unborn child from severe illness in the mother are well established. 

Also worth remembering that it isn’t just a matter of staying more isolated until you hit the 12 week mark. It takes approx. 2 weeks for the vaccine to confer an effect. I’d assume in this time frame your wife would have medical appointments which is realistically where she’s at a higher risk of being exposed. Even if you are both able to reduce your risk outside of this I can’t imagine you’d want to miss checkups/scans? 

On balance I’d say she’s at a greater risk not having it for these reasons.

If it helps I got my first dose in my first trimester and had exactly this on my mind. My thinking was that any fever I may get from the vaccine would probably be 12hrs or so, a fever I would almost certainly get from COVID may last days and my understanding of the research was that a prolonged fever is what is risky. The extra time spent in hospitals etc. pushed me to decide the risk of the vaccine was worth it.

The vaccine can cause a fever, there’s good research to suggest a fever during the first 12 weeks (but especially the first 6) can cause problems such as neural tube defects. It’s not as simple as “they don’t share a blood supply”.

I’m a big fan of watching what people do more than they say. We were trying to get pregnant at the same time she was getting vaccinated. Other pregnant ID fellows got vaccinated. 

The reality (and problem you face it sounds like) is she’s too busy to spend an hour walking you through data. Sorry, the ICU is too full. 

If your worried about fertility/child impacts there’s plenty of vocal OB/GYNs on Twitter that shares a lot of stats

Vikki is an immunologist from your side of the pond with plenty of facts too

Also I’ll call put my 2 year old is Vax’d (Team Pfizer, she was one of the first in the nation under 2 to get the jab as part of a trial). So far the only side effect is she is obsessed with Lego Frozen and CoCo.

Seriously the day after the dose she was weirdly more agreeable (this kid hates the morning). I couldn’t figure out how to report “agreeable child” into VERS.

It doesn’t matter how much research someone on this site can pull up. There could be someone who is antivax who could provide information that looks good and high quality but also omits important information. Not only is your doctor credible but also they know your medical records and history and are the ones who are going to be taking care of you throughout this process. If you don’t trust them get a second opinion

Pretty much you’re saying you’d rather put you wife and babies life in the hands of internet strangers as opposed to a doctor.

You should have a look at:

1. [Government information page about pregnancy and COVID vaccinations](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/pregnancy-breastfeeding-fertility-and-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination/)  
2. [The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynocaelogists covid vaccine page](https://www.rcog.org.uk/covid-vaccine) (a lot of good links there)  
3. [The recent government press release advising pregnant women to get the vaccine](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-chiefs-encourage-more-pregnant-women-to-get-their-covid-19-vaccine)

The upshot of what I have seen has been that it is preferrable to get the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine if you are pregnant (so you are good there).

They also said that there is a risk to your baby if you do get COVID-19, especially during the third trimester. Frankly, if there are no reported risks (other than usual for the population) and there ARE risks to the baby and mother if she gets COVID-19, this seems like a no-brainer.

From [this info pdf](https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/2021-02-24-combined-info-sheet-and-decision-aid.pdf):

&gt; *Studies have shown that hospital admission and severe illness are more common inpregnant women (compared to those not pregnant), especially those in the third trimesterof pregnancy, and that stillbirth and preterm birth is more likely (compared to pregnantwomen without COVID-19). Pregnant women with underlying medical conditions are athigher risk of severe illness*

The risks you should be comparing is not vaccine vs no vaccine. It should be covid symptoms vs vaccine side effects. Covid symptoms are quite a bit worse including for fever. 

That said, one shot does give some protection from getting the virus and from the worst symptoms of the disease. And you may be able to avoid covid by not going out much but it's still not a guarantee. So you are gambling a little bit here by hoping you manage to avoid it until she gets the second shot. It's not a huge gamble, but still a bit of one.

For what it's worth,  I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist.  I'm also a new mother. The only reason I didn't get vaccinated in my first trimester was because the vaccine wasn't available yet.  I got vaccinated as soon as they made the vaccine available to me (December 2020).

Before getting vaccinated,  I reviewed Pfizer phase 1 and 3 trial results as part of a fact-finding, planning assignment for work. The results were great. 

I also talked to physicians at the hospital where I work,  including our Chief Medical Officer,  who happens to be an infectious disease specialist. All of them agreed with and supported my decision to vaccinate.

Pregnancy suppresses the immune system, meaning while we can generate sufficient immune response to confer long term immunity, the sort of turbo charged immune response that could result in spontaneous abortion actually gets dampened a bit. I had the mildest side effects of anybody I knew who got the shots.  Some of my colleagues needed a sick day. I just needed a quick nap.

In contrast, Covid disease hits pregnant patients extra hard. There is much evidence to show that pregnancy outcomes are especially poor when patients are stricken with Covid. Remaining vulnerable for an extra several weeks during an upswing in the pandemic is an unnecessary risk for your wife and the baby.

The actual calculus is ‘vaccine side effects’ vs ‘probability of getting covid * probability of it being a case of severe covid’.

“Roughly two-thirds of pregnant women with COVID-19 have no symptoms at all (also known as being asymptomatic). Most pregnant women who do have symptoms only have mild cold or flu-like symptoms.”

https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/coronavirus-pregnancy/covid-19-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/

I’ve come around to us getting the vaccine earlier but honestly so many of the arguments made on here are so poorly constructed it’s no wonder antivaxers are running rampant.

You throw around the word risk like it’s an absolute, but really it’s just the probability of a negative outcome and the severity of said negative outcome. The risk from Covid is the “risk of contracting” * “risk of sever covid”. The risk from the vaccine is “risk known side effect causing problem” + “potentially unknown side effects” (it’s not like a lot of pregnant women were getting the vaccine 9 months ago). 

These types of decision are always about harm reduction / minimisation.

The vaccine is not “proven to be safe”. It usually has very mild side effects but there is very limited research on its effects during early pregnancy. 

Covid is actually the greater known here since we have good ideas of the risks of exposure and likelihood of it being sever covid. 

Do you know what else has a chance of  terrible life ending side effects? Crossing the road. But I don’t see people arguing we shouldn’t do that. Nothing is an absolute, everything has to be weighed up in comparative risks and rewards.

----------------------------------------
Now we’re getting to the crux of it. I can’t actually find the risk of severe covid in 30-35 year old pregnant women but let’s go with your pulled out of the air figure of 5%. But since I know the first vaccine is 30% effective against Delta let’s drop it to 3% (I don’t know if that’s how it works, but since we’re making up numbers it’ll do). 

Now we have to relate that to our probability of getting covid in the next 7 weeks. Let’s say that’s a 5% chance given our ability to isolate and the declining cases in the Uk. That means we’re looking at a 0.15% chance of a case of severe covid effecting my wife. 

Are you confident that the risk of the vaccine is less than 0.15%? Because I’m not. 

To be honest the numbers are so small I can probably reduce risk more by making sure we pay more attention crossing the road, but this feels like a big choice that has to be made.
