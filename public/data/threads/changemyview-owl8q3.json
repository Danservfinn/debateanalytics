I can\u2019t actually find the risk of severe covid in 30-35 year old pregnant women but let\u2019s go with your pulled out of the air figure of 5%. But since I know the first vaccine is 30% effective against Delta let\u2019s drop it to 3% (I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how it works, but since we\u2019re making up numbers it\u2019ll do). \n\nNow we have to relate that to our probability of getting covid in the next 7 weeks. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s a 5% chance given our ability to isolate and the declining cases in the Uk. That means we\u2019re looking at a 0.15% chance of a case of severe covid effecting my wife. \n\nAre you confident that the risk of the vaccine is less than 0.15%? Because I\u2019m not. \n\nTo be honest the numbers are so small I can probably reduce risk more by making sure we pay more attention crossing the road, but this feels like a big choice that has to be made.",

I can\u2019t actually find the risk of severe covid in 30-35 year old pregnant women but let\u2019s go with your pulled out of the air figure of 5%. But since I know the first vaccine is 30% effective against Delta let\u2019s drop it to 3% (I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how it works, but since we\u2019re making up numbers it\u2019ll do). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we have to relate that to our probability of getting covid in the next 7 weeks. Let\u2019s say that\u2019s a 5% chance given our ability to isolate and the declining cases in the Uk. That means we\u2019re looking at a 0.15% chance of a case of severe covid effecting my wife. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you confident that the risk of the vaccine is less than 0.15%? Because I\u2019m not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest the numbers are so small I can probably reduce risk more by making sure we pay more attention crossing the road, but this feels like a big choice that has to be made.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Taken into account its still a long time to be dodging social life if shes only in her first trimester.\n\nMaybe not much to actually change your view but at least some food for thought.\n\n*i know the vaccine is well tested but pregnant bodies are weird and stuff does happen, its not a big risk at all but something i would think twice about aswell if it were my partner.

That being said, pregnancy might be one of the few reason i understand being extra cautious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the choice youll have to make:\nVaccinate because if your wife does get sick that might actually be bad for the pregnancy, seeing as having a pretty harmfull virus whoch could knock out your respiratory system is not good while being pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or dont vaccinate because she apparently has had her forst shot and is somewhat protected and there might be* some effects whoch havent shown during pregnancies yet. Taken into account its still a long time to be dodging social life if shes only in her first trimester.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe not much to actually change your view but at least some food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*i know the vaccine is well tested but pregnant bodies are weird and stuff does happen, its not a big risk at all but something i would think twice about aswell if it were my partner. That said, i would still advise for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

To address the first concern the tech is actually pretty old (mid 2000s). The same technology has been used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells. In fact that was the original application that lead to the formation of Moderna (the company making a version of the vaccine).  Basically, the vaccine works by transferring an mRNA of the spike protein from COVID19 into your cells. The protein which is not infectious or harmful in itself is then transcribed by the machinery already present in the cells. The cells present the protein to the immune  cells and triggers an immune response and eventually the adaptive immune system forms memory cells to protect against this protein which effectively trains your body to attack the virus.  The mRNA has a polyA tail that acts as a sort of timer for the life of the injected mRNA so that it naturally degrades and goes away within a relatively short time frame.  The delivery system for the mRNA is a lipid nanoparticle that surrounds the mRNA and fuses with the cell  membrane to enter the cell.  The tech behind this has decades of literature, and it has been extensively studied as a drug delivery system including in pregnancy and found to be generally safe. Finally, the covid19 vaccines were found to be safe in pregnant animals. To address the speed concern. Modern tech has made it super cheap fast and easy to sequence anything including viruses. And since a lot of work has already been put into studying cornoviruses, it was rather simple to identify the spike protein genes after getting the sequence and then to design the mRNA and load it into the lipid nanoparticles. This tech is much easier and faster than the older methods of designing vaccines. Unfortunately, drug companies and the FDA have a stick with what works philosophy since they are adverse to change, so it took a pandemic to trigger the switch to the quicker and likely better tech. Finally, due to the public eye on the vaccine any side effects are highly publicized leading to people giving too much weight to small risks, like the blood clots from the JNJ vaccine (odds are less than 1 in 1 million or \\~three times less likely than being struck by lightning, also JNJ uses a totally different tech from the pfizer vaccine so it's irrelevant to this discussion) .  So with this knowledge, the vaccine is actually quite safe.  The question you must ask is risks associated with covid19 less than the risks associated with the vaccine, and I would say the evidence is no, so get the second dose.",
