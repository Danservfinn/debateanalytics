Thank you everyone for your posts. \n\n**My takeaways:**\n+ I had not thought about all the people who simply cannot get the vaccine, due to medical or other reasons.\n+ I have a better understanding of the normal 10-15 year vaccine process and how we\u2019re following the same process (currently on Phase 3), but skipping those first 2-4 years that a normal vaccine has to go through, primarily because of money.\n+ We have a long ways to go for herd immunity.\n+ Some of y\u2019all are insecure wolves. God damn. A man simply questions the status quo and all of a sudden I\u2019m selfish, dumb, an asshole, what\u2019s wrong with society, don\u2019t care about anyone besides the people I know, etc. \n\n**My consensus:**\nI don\u2019t like the societal and governmental pressure. I don\u2019t like people telling me I\u2019m an idiot for thinking this way. I don\u2019t like the government threatening to restrict my life if I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t like not having a choice. It\u2019s those kind of things that make me want to resist. And when I\u2019m nervous or uncomfortable about something as it is, then have to deal with all the pressure on top of it... I mean y\u2019all gotta empathize for how that feels, and how it effects your decision making.\n\nThe best reason I heard was the people who cannot get vaccinated. There\u2019s no answer for them other than others getting vaccinated. I don\u2019t think we have any fuckin chance of hitting the required herd immunity levels, so honestly that\u2019s not a factor here. I\u2019m not as concerned about the vaccine anymore. I really do not think I can get infected again, just based on how much I\u2019ve been in packed bars this year. I guess I could have gotten it and been asymptomatic again, but I prolly woulda infected someone? Idk.\n\nI\u2019m going to get an antibody test this week, just out of curiosity. Then I think next week I\u2019ll get the vaccine. I\u2019m gonna give it till next week just so I can make sure I\u2019m comfortable with it before doing it.\n\nTo all those with the condescending, dickhead comments, trying to guilt me into it, or just make me feel bad, you did nothing to sway me. To those that took your time giving me good information, and were empathetic to my situation, or at least neutral, thank you.\n\nHappy Tuesday y\u2019all\n- Pickle Rick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince I keep getting the same responses! These are the points of the reasons\n+ Reason 1: Why I don\u2019t want to, or am wary of, getting it.\n+ Reason 2: Why I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be a risk to others.\n+ Reason 3: Why I think others will be protected.\n+ **Reason 4: Why I don\u2019t need it, personally, my well-being. Stop commenting about this one. Obviously it\u2019s a point completely concerned with myself. I literally said, \u201cnot a main reason at all\u201d. If I\u2019m deciding to get the vaccine, shouldn\u2019t I consider my own health? Ffs focus on the other 3 points**\n\nHere me out.\n\nSo I\u2019m still on the fence about getting it, but right now I do not want to get it. I would love to hear people out though. Two weeks ago I was scheduled to get it, started stressing, and reached out to a bunch of friends to see what they were doing.\n\nTo my surprise, hardly any of my 25ish circle of friends are getting vaccinated. I only know of 2 of them that are. And only 3 of us believe crazy conspiracies (they\u2019re all morons). I really don\u2019t think any of the 4 reasons stated below falls under crazy propaganda or conspiracy. The main reasons for my friends and I not getting it are:\n\n**1) We don\u2019t know the long term effects.**\n\nIts a very new vaccine that didn\u2019t get the [normal 10-15 years of testing](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation) that every other vaccine gets. There is no denying that there was a huge rush to get these developed. Yes I know there was a global pandemic so obviously a rush. However, and I promise this is my only political point, but there was also a massive financial motive to get it done ASAP. Pfizer and Moderna are projected to make [$30 billion in vaccine sales this year.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/11/business/pfizer-vaccine-covid-moderna-revenue/index.html) They would not have made anything if they delayed to perform testing for another year. All of the vaccine companies were in a race with each other to see who could get it done first. Sorry, but you are simply naive if you think the pandemic and global health was the ONLY motive for their rush. The long term effects is a genuine concern I have, and makes me really uncomfortable to get it.\n\nI will say, half of my friends that I asked said they just wanna wait to see how it goes with everyone else. I kinda feel the same way, we\u2019re just uncomfortable with it. However, none of us actually have any idea how long that wait is gonna be. I\u2019d wager majority who said that just end up never getting it.\n\n*If you try to make some argument about the yearly flu vaccines, you have no idea how vaccines work. Source: 2 genius doctors in my family (who are both very pro vaccine).*\n\n**2) Antibodies. My friends and I have all had it.**\n\nOkay so the data on this varies. A [quick google search ](https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+reinfection+rate&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari)  you can see 10+ different articles. At very worst, it\u2019s looking like a 20% chance of reinfection. At very best less than 1%, but I doubt that.\n\n**3) Every single at risk person I know is vaccinated.**\n\nMy parents and grandparents, my friends parents, etc. They should be protected right? Over 60% of the country (US) has already gotten at least their first shot. And it\u2019s soooo easy to get a shot these days, anyone who\u2019s really worried about their health has no excuse not to have it. \n\nInformation about the vaccine efficacy rates vary. This is from [Pfizer\u2019s](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious) website: \n\n*\u201dVaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 95.3% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u201d*\n\n**4) I\u2019m healthy and was asymptotic.**\n\nNot a main reason at all. But I\u2019m 26, healthy, and had 0 symptoms when I got infected. Only reason I got tested was because my roommates had it.\n\n\nIf you combine:\n+ Majority of people are vaccinated\n+ The likelihood that we have proper antibodies\n+ My age and health\n+ All the masks, social distancing, etc\n\n\nThen:\n1. I feel confident that my loved ones are safe. \n2. I don\u2019t see why I need to take on the risk when we don\u2019t know the long-term effects.\n3. I don\u2019t see how me getting the vaccine will make an impact on society or the pandemic.\n\nLet me be clear, I\u2019m really not anti-vax. I don\u2019t think people are sheep for getting it. I don\u2019t think of anyone any differently if they get it. I think our doctors and scientists probably did a great job in developing these vaccines. I\u2019ve been for the masks the whole time. It\u2019s simply that given the 4 reasons I stated above, I am not comfortable, nor do I feel a moral obligation, to get it.\n\nAnd if anyone thinks it\u2019s because of my political views, 15-20 of us are democrats, including myself. Fuck Trump.\n\nGive me your worst Reddit.\n\n*Edit for formatting",

The Pfizer phase 3 trials started last July, so we'll be hitting 1 year of widespread use in humans soon. In addition, the millions of does given provide a huge sample for potential effects - way more than any trials that might have taken place.\n\nI'd also add that your relatively low chance of death from covid shouldn't be the only concern - there's always also the risk of allowing new strains to develop. The more a virus spreads, the more chances it has to mutate into a more potent strain, and by accepting a higher risk of your personal infection, you're not doing your part in helping to prevent this.",

There is no need for these scientists to do anything but work on covid, and there are a multitude of people wanting to do this work.

Any time there is a suspected correlation, they start researching it because correlation does not equal causation. You also cannot always compare the risk of no vaccine no illness, when the illness is so widespread.  So instead of comparing the rates of, for example, clotting issues, you can't compare it just to a person never exposed to covid who has never been vaccinated, because covid exists and is incredibly contagious.

They were able to \"skip\" some of Phase 0 because they had already been working on a similar coronavirus vaccine for SARS/MERS (which weren't as contagious and thankfully went away on their own, but that also meant the money and researchers went away because it wasn't a threat)\n\nTo use small, made up numbers as an example. in a normal situation 5 out of a 100 people might get a certain type of clot every year, before covid.  Among all patients who get covid, 30 out of 100 might have that kind of clot - an alarming increase.  With the vaccine, maybe 10 out of 100 get that clot.  Yes, that is a higher rate than the no covid, no vaccine group, but if you don't get the vaccine, you will eventually get covid, so your real risk is 30 in 100.  So while there might be a small increase over the theoretical person living in a pre-covid world, the reality is that it is a dramatic decrease for the person living in the post covid world.  (again, these are not real numbers, but little numbers are easier to understand and this is just to show how it is evaluated)  Or it could be that still only 5 out of 100 get that clot, and while those five get extra scrutiny during new vaccination programs, that's to make sure that it is the \"expected\" baseline and not close to the risk of covid itself.",

And the purpose of all the previous stages is to make sure nothing goes wrong in Phase III (and nothing really significant has, with a *massive* sample size). It's not like you'd catch more stuff as opposed to Phase III if you were in earlier phases for longer, it just makes it less risky to jump to a new phase.

And the purpose of all the previous stages is to make sure nothing goes wrong in Phase III (and nothing really significant has, with a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; sample size). It&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;d catch more stuff as opposed to Phase III if you were in earlier phases for longer, it just makes it less risky to jump to a new phase. But Phase III has lasted for approx the normal length of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Also the fact that you just said the long term effects of COVID are probably worse than the vaccine... how can you possibly make that claim? We have no clue.\n\nWhat I meant here was that it\u2019s okay to be concerned about these things like long term health impacts of the vaccine, but the vaccines are based on existing medical methods/technology that has been researched many, many, times before, while we literally can\u2019t know what the long term impacts of COVID will be because it\u2019s new to us. \n\n[Here\u2019s](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine) an article that goes over how, historically speaking, vaccines that do have long term health impacts, those long term impacts tend to show up within the first 4 months after vaccination.\n\n&gt;2.\t\u2060Ya. It\u2019s pretty all over the place but the worst I saw was 20% chance of reinfection. \n\nI haven\u2019t looked into the reinfection rate much, I just know that it\u2019s pretty unknown as of now. Literally every scientific source says something different and they all include disclaimers about how difficult it is to get an accurate number due to data issues. \n\nWith that said, I think it\u2019s a good idea to keep in mind that herd immunity is the overall goal, so if there\u2019s a 20% chance of reinfection, only 35% of the population is vaccinated and those vaccines are only 95% effective, that could **really** damage our ability to reach herd immunity. \n\nSay we have a population of 100. 35 of those people are vaccinated, which means that 31 of them will likely be immune, while the other 4 aren\u2019t. At this point, we have 31 people immune &amp; 69 who are not. If we factor in the number of people who have had it and decided not to get vaccinated (I really have no idea how to get this number, so my math example kind of ends here), then the number of people who are immune only increases by 80% of that number. We also have to remove the number of people who can\u2019t get vaccinated due to medical reasons, and they will overall count against the \u201cimmune\u201d population. \n\n&gt;Do we even know if the vaccine will protect us from all these strains?\n\nThis is another issue to add on to the above equation. We don\u2019t know how effective they are on different strains, but the CDC says that the current vaccines do offer [at least some protection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html) to the new variants, and some protection &gt; no protection. \n\n&gt;4.\t\u2060This was the only point that was just me being like, I\u2019m fine. If my argument is I don\u2019t think I should get it, shouldn\u2019t I probably consider my own health???\n\nIt\u2019s not that your health doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s that you not being worried about catching it a second time because it wasn\u2019t bad for you the first time is kind of besides the point. Does that make more sense? \n\n&gt;From what I\u2019m seeing it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll ever reach 75%, definitely not 85-95\n\nWhich is all the more reason for every single person to do their part and try to get vaccinated. We should all want to achieve herd immunity\u2014 it\u2019s how we get our lives back to normal. \n\n&gt;So you\u2019re saying we don\u2019t know the long term efficacy as a good point, but when I say long term issues it\u2019s not a good point?\n\nI don\u2019t see how these are really related? \n\nIf we aren\u2019t sure about the long term effectiveness of the COVID vaccine, that should mean that everyone should want to get it in a short period of time so we can achieve herd immunity before the vaccines stop offering the same level of protection. \n\nYour concern about not knowing the long term health impacts of the vaccines is valid, but when you look into it more, it\u2019s not exactly a huge risk.",

We have no clue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I meant here was that it\u2019s okay to be concerned about these things like long term health impacts of the vaccine, but the vaccines are based on existing medical methods/technology that has been researched many, many, times before, while we literally can\u2019t know what the long term impacts of COVID will be because it\u2019s new to us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine\"&gt;Here\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; an article that goes over how, historically speaking, vaccines that do have long term health impacts, those long term impacts tend to show up within the first 4 months after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u2060Ya. It\u2019s pretty all over the place but the worst I saw was 20% chance of reinfection. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven\u2019t looked into the reinfection rate much, I just know that it\u2019s pretty unknown as of now. Literally every scientific source says something different and they all include disclaimers about how difficult it is to get an accurate number due to data issues. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that said, I think it\u2019s a good idea to keep in mind that herd immunity is the overall goal, so if there\u2019s a 20% chance of reinfection, only 35% of the population is vaccinated and those vaccines are only 95% effective, that could &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; damage our ability to reach herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say we have a population of 100. 35 of those people are vaccinated, which means that 31 of them will likely be immune, while the other 4 aren\u2019t. At this point, we have 31 people immune &amp;amp; 69 who are not. If we factor in the number of people who have had it and decided not to get vaccinated (I really have no idea how to get this number, so my math example kind of ends here), then the number of people who are immune only increases by 80% of that number. We also have to remove the number of people who can\u2019t get vaccinated due to medical reasons, and they will overall count against the \u201cimmune\u201d population. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do we even know if the vaccine will protect us from all these strains?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is another issue to add on to the above equation. We don\u2019t know how effective they are on different strains, but the CDC says that the current vaccines do offer &lt;a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html\"&gt;at least some protection&lt;/a&gt; to the new variants, and some protection &amp;gt; no protection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\u2060This was the only point that was just me being like, I\u2019m fine. If my argument is I don\u2019t think I should get it, shouldn\u2019t I probably consider my own health???&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not that your health doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s that you not being worried about catching it a second time because it wasn\u2019t bad for you the first time is kind of besides the point. Does that make more sense? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From what I\u2019m seeing it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll ever reach 75%, definitely not 85-95&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is all the more reason for every single person to do their part and try to get vaccinated. We should all want to achieve herd immunity\u2014 it\u2019s how we get our lives back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So you\u2019re saying we don\u2019t know the long term efficacy as a good point, but when I say long term issues it\u2019s not a good point?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t see how these are really related? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we aren\u2019t sure about the long term effectiveness of the COVID vaccine, that should mean that everyone should want to get it in a short period of time so we can achieve herd immunity before the vaccines stop offering the same level of protection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your concern about not knowing the long term health impacts of the vaccines is valid, but when you look into it more, it\u2019s not exactly a huge risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Your concerns about long term impacts of the vaccine are warranted, however, they do have methods to study long term impacts in the short term for vaccine development. They do not have as many methods to study long term impacts of a very new disease in the short term. So basically: the risk of long term issues from getting the vaccine is probably a lot less than the risk of issues from catching COVID. \n\n2. We still don\u2019t know if catching COVID makes you immune to catching it again, let alone catching different strains. \n\n3. Vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective. That\u2019s why we rely on herd immunity. \n\n4. The vaccine isn\u2019t necessarily about you. It\u2019s about herd immunity. \n\nIn terms of the rest of your post: \n\n- The majority of people are not fully vaccinated. Only 31% of the US population is fully vaccinated, and herd immunity for COVID is closer to 75% (this is an estimate because the % vaccinated for each disease is dependent on the disease itself.. and COVID-19 is still very new to us. So while we might know the percentage it takes to achieve herd immunity for something like polio, we don\u2019t know what that number is exactly for COVID), and Fauci suggests that it will be closer to 85-95% of the population before we reach herd immunity. \n\n- We don\u2019t know if exposure to the virus even develops the right antibodies to prevent you from getting it again. \n\n- Your age and your health wont prevent you from being a carrier (just a reminder that COVID is **extremely** contagious... hence is why it\u2019s disrupted our lives so much). \n\n- People are very eager to get back to normal life, so less people will be taking it seriously. This means that you can\u2019t rely on masks and social distancing alone. \n\nSo, overall, herd immunity is the goal and that\u2019s when we can all start seeing our individual situation as separate from the community. We are nowhere close to herd immunity, but you can help us get there by getting the vaccine. \n\nWith that said, I do want to point out one more thing: the vaccines long term effectiveness is unknown. Because of that, it\u2019s very likely that everyone who got their vaccine will need a booster shot 6 or so months later. This implies that we have 6 months after the first dose was administered in the US to achieve herd immunity. We\u2019re very quickly approaching that deadline, and we\u2019ve still only vaccinated 31% of the population. Doing your part &amp; getting the vaccine is really the best thing you can do at this point.",

Is that a concern? Sure. So is getting Covid. Which has some long term side effects that are known (and who knows what else may develop (yes i know this goes both ways)). While i know you said you had it, it is possible to get it again, there are many recorded re-infections, as well as untold mutations that you *may be susceptible to. While you *could be asymptomatic again you *could pass it on to others and even tho many have been vaccinated there is no guarantee that the vaccine will protect them from unknown mutations. (Yes I realize this whole thing is a double edged sword).\n\n2)While I cant guarantee i had it, pretty much everyone i have spoken with un the medical profession agrees i did. I had gone on a ski trip with 9 friends in early february of 2020. If you remember then, covid wasn't really a thing. The state i lived in only had 1 case and the states we traveled to all had 0 (as we know now many people were asymptomatic carries). Anyways, we all came back and were ill within 3 days of returning, some sooner than others. For me it was the worst case of \"the flu\" i have ever had. I literally could not get off the couch for 6 days straight. But testing was not readily available then, nor was it a concern, so it was just assumed to be flu until more info came out months down the line. At any rate, a few of us had anti-body tests done towards the end on last year (8 to 10 mo after the trip) and none of us had anti-bodies. Again, none of us can guarantee we actually had it, but it is likely, and we were told that the anti-bodies would have dissipated over time and that we were likely too late to get an appropriate reading. Point is, antibodies dissipate. Yes your body is now better at fighting the virus, but many medical professionals are saying most people will need to continue getting annual booster shots for the vaccine.\n\n3) The vaccine is not 100% effective. \n\n4) Again, that does not mean you can't get it again or pass it on again. I agree it drops rates significantly, but it is still possible for re-contraction and even to pass on to people with vaccine (although its a very low %, it is possible).  \n\n5) Do you like wearing masks?  I personally am tired of wearing them. I realize it will still be a while before the mandates are gone, but governing bodies will not chose to lift those restrictions until the see significant numbers of people getting vaccines. If you look at the data, were at about 1/2 population and daily vaccine rates are dropping sharply, meaning people are skipping the second one (means you're still at risk) or not getting it at all.",

It's totally irrational and I know and acknowledge it. So if you were to be afraid of vaccine but know it's not really logic, then it wouldn't be dumb.\n\nSo the problem here is just that you have bad estimation of risk. More accurate numbers would be:\n\n* 0.05% to die for 26M (assuming you're not obese, don't smoke and don't have chronic illness)\n* 0.5% to suffer from long term side effect\n* less than 0.0001%  \n* No substance on earth is known for being able to give hidden serious long term effect with a 0.5ml taken twice that wouldn't be already visible after a few weeks so 0%\n\nNow it's not being dumb to not evaluate risks well, it's often complex but as long as you're willing to change your estimation if given serious sources then it's not being dumb but just lacking information\n\n**however** if you don't trust excess mortality rate to [confirm Covid death numbers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/us/covid-19-death-toll.html) and argue that less than 500k people died from Covid then I won't try to make you look dumb but will say it directly: you are dumb and the only way to change your opinion is to make you understand that you are dumb.

It&amp;#39;s totally irrational and I know and acknowledge it. So if you were to be afraid of vaccine but know it&amp;#39;s not really logic, then it wouldn&amp;#39;t be dumb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the problem here is just that you have bad estimation of risk. More accurate numbers would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;0.05% to die for 26M (assuming you&amp;#39;re not obese, don&amp;#39;t smoke and don&amp;#39;t have chronic illness)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;0.5% to suffer from long term side effect&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;less than 0.0001%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No substance on earth is known for being able to give hidden serious long term effect with a 0.5ml taken twice that wouldn&amp;#39;t be already visible after a few weeks so 0%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#39;s not being dumb to not evaluate risks well, it&amp;#39;s often complex but as long as you&amp;#39;re willing to change your estimation if given serious sources then it&amp;#39;s not being dumb but just lacking information&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;however&lt;/strong&gt; if you don&amp;#39;t trust excess mortality rate to &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/us/covid-19-death-toll.html\"&gt;confirm Covid death numbers&lt;/a&gt; and argue that less than 500k people died from Covid then I won&amp;#39;t try to make you look dumb but will say it directly: you are dumb and the only way to change your opinion is to make you understand that you are dumb. (but it&amp;#39;s almost impossible)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It has still undergone lots of trials thought, so you can\u2019t dispute that these effects are minimal, if you do, then there\u2019s not a discussion to be had. Moreover, I know that the risk for those in your age group may be predominantly marginal groups (like asthmatics / other underlying diseases). Additionally, there is a shortage of vaccines worldwide and many people you will come into contact with may not have had the vaccine (especially if you travel / live in a tourist area).\n\nNobody really has the authority to really tell you that you **have** to get the vaccine. If you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine and justification enough. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s reasonable though, when you would benefit from it and so will others for a tiny level of risk. If you getting a vaccine would save 1 person from having 2-3 months in ICU, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s the moral thing to do. **You do you though**, if you don\u2019t want to get vaccinated yet that\u2019s completely your choice but you should own that rather than trying to find alternate justification.",

It has still undergone lots of trials thought, so you can\u2019t dispute that these effects are minimal, if you do, then there\u2019s not a discussion to be had. Moreover, I know that the risk for those in your age group may be predominantly marginal groups (like asthmatics / other underlying diseases). Additionally, there is a shortage of vaccines worldwide and many people you will come into contact with may not have had the vaccine (especially if you travel / live in a tourist area).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody really has the authority to really tell you that you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to get the vaccine. If you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine and justification enough. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s reasonable though, when you would benefit from it and so will others for a tiny level of risk. If you getting a vaccine would save 1 person from having 2-3 months in ICU, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s the moral thing to do. &lt;strong&gt;You do you though&lt;/strong&gt;, if you don\u2019t want to get vaccinated yet that\u2019s completely your choice but you should own that rather than trying to find alternate justification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
