## POST BODY
----------------------------------------
Alright I’m done replying. Thank you everyone for your posts. 

**My takeaways:**
+ I had not thought about all the people who simply cannot get the vaccine, due to medical or other reasons.
+ I have a better understanding of the normal 10-15 year vaccine process and how we’re following the same process (currently on Phase 3), but skipping those first 2-4 years that a normal vaccine has to go through, primarily because of money.
+ We have a long ways to go for herd immunity.
+ Some of y’all are insecure wolves. God damn. A man simply questions the status quo and all of a sudden I’m selfish, dumb, an asshole, what’s wrong with society, don’t care about anyone besides the people I know, etc. 

**My consensus:**
I don’t like the societal and governmental pressure. I don’t like people telling me I’m an idiot for thinking this way. I don’t like the government threatening to restrict my life if I don’t get it. I don’t like not having a choice. It’s those kind of things that make me want to resist. And when I’m nervous or uncomfortable about something as it is, then have to deal with all the pressure on top of it... I mean y’all gotta empathize for how that feels, and how it effects your decision making.

The best reason I heard was the people who cannot get vaccinated. There’s no answer for them other than others getting vaccinated. I don’t think we have any fuckin chance of hitting the required herd immunity levels, so honestly that’s not a factor here. I’m not as concerned about the vaccine anymore. I really do not think I can get infected again, just based on how much I’ve been in packed bars this year. I guess I could have gotten it and been asymptomatic again, but I prolly woulda infected someone? Idk.

I’m going to get an antibody test this week, just out of curiosity. Then I think next week I’ll get the vaccine. I’m gonna give it till next week just so I can make sure I’m comfortable with it before doing it.

To all those with the condescending, dickhead comments, trying to guilt me into it, or just make me feel bad, you did nothing to sway me. To those that took your time giving me good information, and were empathetic to my situation, or at least neutral, thank you.

Happy Tuesday y’all

Since I keep getting the same responses! These are the points of the reasons
+ Reason 1: Why I don’t want to, or am wary of, getting it.
+ Reason 2: Why I don’t think I’ll be a risk to others.
+ Reason 3: Why I think others will be protected.
+ **Reason 4: Why I don’t need it, personally, my well-being. Stop commenting about this one. Obviously it’s a point completely concerned with myself. I literally said, “not a main reason at all”. If I’m deciding to get the vaccine, shouldn’t I consider my own health? Ffs focus on the other 3 points**

Here me out.

So I’m still on the fence about getting it, but right now I do not want to get it. I would love to hear people out though. Two weeks ago I was scheduled to get it, started stressing, and reached out to a bunch of friends to see what they were doing.

To my surprise, hardly any of my 25ish circle of friends are getting vaccinated. I only know of 2 of them that are. And only 3 of us believe crazy conspiracies (they’re all morons). I really don’t think any of the 4 reasons stated below falls under crazy propaganda or conspiracy. The main reasons for my friends and I not getting it are:

**1) We don’t know the long term effects.**

Its a very new vaccine that didn’t get the [normal 10-15 years of testing](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation) that every other vaccine gets. There is no denying that there was a huge rush to get these developed. Yes I know there was a global pandemic so obviously a rush. However, and I promise this is my only political point, but there was also a massive financial motive to get it done ASAP. Pfizer and Moderna are projected to make [$30 billion in vaccine sales this year.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/11/business/pfizer-vaccine-covid-moderna-revenue/index.html) They would not have made anything if they delayed to perform testing for another year. All of the vaccine companies were in a race with each other to see who could get it done first. Sorry, but you are simply naive if you think the pandemic and global health was the ONLY motive for their rush. The long term effects is a genuine concern I have, and makes me really uncomfortable to get it.

I will say, half of my friends that I asked said they just wanna wait to see how it goes with everyone else. I kinda feel the same way, we’re just uncomfortable with it. However, none of us actually have any idea how long that wait is gonna be. I’d wager majority who said that just end up never getting it.

*If you try to make some argument about the yearly flu vaccines, you have no idea how vaccines work. Source: 2 genius doctors in my family (who are both very pro vaccine).*

**2) Antibodies. My friends and I have all had it.**

Okay so the data on this varies. A [quick google search ](https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+reinfection+rate&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari)  you can see 10+ different articles. At very worst, it’s looking like a 20% chance of reinfection. At very best less than 1%, but I doubt that.

**3) Every single at risk person I know is vaccinated.**

My parents and grandparents, my friends parents, etc. They should be protected right? Over 60% of the country (US) has already gotten at least their first shot. And it’s soooo easy to get a shot these days, anyone who’s really worried about their health has no excuse not to have it. 

Information about the vaccine efficacy rates vary. This is from [Pfizer’s](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious) website: 

*”Vaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 95.3% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration”*

**4) I’m healthy and was asymptotic.**

Not a main reason at all. But I’m 26, healthy, and had 0 symptoms when I got infected. Only reason I got tested was because my roommates had it.


If you combine:
+ Majority of people are vaccinated
+ The likelihood that we have proper antibodies
+ My age and health
+ All the masks, social distancing, etc


Then:
1. I feel confident that my loved ones are safe. 
2. I don’t see why I need to take on the risk when we don’t know the long-term effects.
3. I don’t see how me getting the vaccine will make an impact on society or the pandemic.

Let me be clear, I’m really not anti-vax. I don’t think people are sheep for getting it. I don’t think of anyone any differently if they get it. I think our doctors and scientists probably did a great job in developing these vaccines. I’ve been for the masks the whole time. It’s simply that given the 4 reasons I stated above, I am not comfortable, nor do I feel a moral obligation, to get it.

And if anyone thinks it’s because of my political views, 15-20 of us are democrats, including myself. Fuck Trump.

Give me your worst Reddit.

These are reasons why you might not personally need to worry about Covid, not why you shouldn't get vaccinated. And the reasons you give are no different than your typical antimasker or antivax person.

You have no idea that state if your immune system or antibodies. You will be interacting with people outside of your immediate circle who you are putting at risk. And you are actively and purposefully delaying herd immunity for the entire population. 

Get vaccinated.

If you don't believe the Covid vaccines are safe and effective at preventing the contraction of the disease, for you or your loved ones, then there's little evidence I could provide to convince you. 

However, I'd like to know what specific long-term effect you believe vaccination threatens? Contraction of covid? Death from some toxic chemical in the serum? Amputation from a hasty needle jab? Some miraculous re-writing of our genetics?

It's not to sound obstinate, but the comparison of this vaccine to the disease by measure of risk of life, hospitalization, and/or lifelong complications is like comparing apples and oranges. Or a hand grenade to a nuke. 

You said it yourself, you were asymptomatic when you first contracted it; you may not even know if you had it again, or how long the course of the disease actually lasted. And in all that time, you could have dutifully spread it to all your loved ones. 
Vaccines are only so effective when 40% of the population could be a potential harbor for the pathogen. 

Why be difficult, for a free vaccination, to care for your family and community?

People who are illegal immigrants or, for other reasons, not registered to receive the vaccine. 

People who are ill (temporarily or permanently) and their illness prevents them getting the vaccine.

This is the answer. The reasons in the OP are all associated with why the OP wouldn’t benefit from the vaccine. The nod toward “all the at risk people I know” is just that - a nod. 

You have no idea the vaccination status of anyone you’re interacting with outside your circle, and even less of the people *they* are interacting with. There are people who can’t (yet?) get a covid vaccine; the whole way that vaccines work is in breaking the chains of transmission in the population. Every person who can get vaccinated who does contributes to that.

Will it make a difference if you, on your own, make a choice not to get vaccinated? To the population as a whole, probably not. But if large numbers of young, healthy people decide not to get vaccinated that could fuck things up unnecessarily. 

Getting vaccinated is an unselfish thing to do, a contribution to society. It’s not a thing to do a personal cost/benefit for.

1) the reason vaccines usually take so long is not because of some long term safety study. vaccines are developed using grants and other funding and researchers have to constantly update those who fund them and often spend more time seeking out new funding than they do developing the vaccine. the covid vaccine was fully funded from the go so there was no hoop jumping

To protect everyone we need herd immunity. 

1. Your concerns about long term impacts of the vaccine are warranted, however, they do have methods to study long term impacts in the short term for vaccine development. They do not have as many methods to study long term impacts of a very new disease in the short term. So basically: the risk of long term issues from getting the vaccine is probably a lot less than the risk of issues from catching COVID. 

2. We still don’t know if catching COVID makes you immune to catching it again, let alone catching different strains. 

3. Vaccines aren’t 100% effective. That’s why we rely on herd immunity. 

4. The vaccine isn’t necessarily about you. It’s about herd immunity. 

In terms of the rest of your post: 

- The majority of people are not fully vaccinated. Only 31% of the US population is fully vaccinated, and herd immunity for COVID is closer to 75% (this is an estimate because the % vaccinated for each disease is dependent on the disease itself.. and COVID-19 is still very new to us. So while we might know the percentage it takes to achieve herd immunity for something like polio, we don’t know what that number is exactly for COVID), and Fauci suggests that it will be closer to 85-95% of the population before we reach herd immunity. 

- We don’t know if exposure to the virus even develops the right antibodies to prevent you from getting it again. 

- Your age and your health wont prevent you from being a carrier (just a reminder that COVID is **extremely** contagious... hence is why it’s disrupted our lives so much). 

- People are very eager to get back to normal life, so less people will be taking it seriously. This means that you can’t rely on masks and social distancing alone. 

So, overall, herd immunity is the goal and that’s when we can all start seeing our individual situation as separate from the community. We are nowhere close to herd immunity, but you can help us get there by getting the vaccine. 

With that said, I do want to point out one more thing: the vaccines long term effectiveness is unknown. Because of that, it’s very likely that everyone who got their vaccine will need a booster shot 6 or so months later. This implies that we have 6 months after the first dose was administered in the US to achieve herd immunity. We’re very quickly approaching that deadline, and we’ve still only vaccinated 31% of the population. Doing your part &amp; getting the vaccine is really the best thing you can do at this point.

&gt;1) We don’t know the long term effects.

We *do* know some long -term effects of Covid, however,  including lasting damage to heart,  lung,  and brain tissue. (Also found in mild symptomatic cases) 
 So,  your argument is you'd rather avoid some vague, unknown future problem and instead risk the current issue at hand?  And on top of that,  increase the risk to those who *can't* get a vaccine? 
That's naive, and selfish.  ("Everyone *I know* will be okay) 

Also,  just because you have antibodies,  doesn't mean you can't get it.  Its all about the viral load.  If you pick it up from multiple sources  (like all your friends who are also not vaxxed)  you will carry more of the virus and likely get sick (see back to the long-term effects)

You are not afraid of getting that disease that killed 500k and had lasting long time effect on 3 million in the US alone again but you're afraid of the almost inexistent chance of the vaccine having hidden long term effect?

I mean don't you see the problem? do you think you're being rational and it's not like being afraid of taking a plane and not being afraid of taking a car when statistically, it's proven the second is more dangerous?

Could you try to put into percentage your estimation of the risk of both:

* 1) Getting COVID again and dying
* 2) Getting COVID again and having long term complication
* 3) Getting vaccine and dying 
* 4) Getting vaccine and suffering from long term side effects.

Chemotherapy, immune system dysfunction, history of anaphylaxis. Vaccines have failure rates and with a disease as contagious as covid, you have to get the entire population vaccinated for vaccination to fully work and provide herd immunity.  Covid likely needs levels close to what we need for measles.

A lot of that testing is done slowly, sometimes because it's hard to recruit for the trials, sometimes because the money isn't there, and always because it was done with each phase happening, then time being taken to regroup, rerecruit for trials, getting through the administrative hoops.  

People have been throwing money at this. There is no need for these scientists to do anything but work on covid, and there are a multitude of people wanting to do this work.  It's not a single team of 60 people trying to coordinate all of this, it's a worldwide emergency where other research was stopped to make sure people could focus on this. 

People are jumping at the chance to be in the clinical trials.  Instead of recruitment for the trials taking 2-3 years, they can fill their trials in less than a week.  

The scientists are not having to wait 6 month-1 year to get peer review for their work, the moment they have results, they have peers ready and willing to review it. Instead of it going to people and languishing while other people are busy with other things. 

Committees that may only meet every six months or even just annually that provide approvals to move forward and to review results are making special meetings so there isn't a delay. And instead of running phase II and phase III years apart (partially due to the above reasons) they did mix II/III trials.  Phase I tests for basic safety and is the smallest, it will catch big issues of safety.  It does not evaluate efficacy.  Phase II trials are basically proof of concept  - the "does it work" phase of the game. It has larger numbers, but still will not catch very rare side effects/reactions, because if 1 in 1 million have an issue, giving it to 50k people might not have that issue.  

Phase III is "is it better than placebo"? - Which is why it can be combined with phase II trials - especially when you are in a situation where there is not another existing treatment or vaccine existing.  Still not large enough to catch rare adverse effects.  

Post-market monitoring or Phase IV is what happens next, after the above trials have been completed and monitors for side effects that would be impossible to see in clinical trial numbers.  Any time there is a suspected correlation, they start researching it because correlation does not equal causation. You also cannot always compare the risk of no vaccine no illness, when the illness is so widespread.  So instead of comparing the rates of, for example, clotting issues, you can't compare it just to a person never exposed to covid who has never been vaccinated, because covid exists and is incredibly contagious.  So you have to compare it to the risks of people who get covid (both symptomatic and asymptomatic)

A huge amount of that 10 to 15 years of testing is finding participants and funding as well as dealing with regulatory requirements and waiting for people to get infected in adequate numbers for things to be statistically meaningful. Most diseases we don't already have vaccines for are are either rare, typically mild, and/or predominately effect developing countries, which makes it harder to find funding, volunteers, and an adequate number of infections in the trial. Covid had the unusual situation where there was a fairly serious disease occurring at high levels in places that had the means and interest in throwing money and time at the trials.

&gt;**1) We don’t know the long term effects.**

When vaccines have adverse effects, they [nearly always](https://www.chop.edu/news/long-term-side-effects-covid-19-vaccine) occur within 2 months of taking them. While it's theoretically possible that *you* could experience long-term effects that have gone undiscovered in the past year of trials / rollout to 100s of millions of people, it's also possible that you may get infected and die from COVID next month. Both are unlikely.

&gt;**2) Antibodies. My friends and I have all had it.**

Although the [risk is reduced](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/previous-covid-19-may-cut-risk-reinfection-84), there are [confirmed cases](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30764-7/fulltext) of COVID reinfection. Evidence suggests that [any immunity is temporary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7747024/).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**3) Every single at risk person I know is vaccinated.**

They are much better protected than if they hadn't taken the vaccine (95% efficacy in Pfizer/Moderna), but there is still a chance that you may be putting them at *unnecessary* risk, and can infect them even if they've been vaccinated and you are asypmtomatic.

[Symptomatic reinfection has been found](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33257644/) to have happened in patients who were previously asymptomatic.

&gt;I’d assume the reason why the adverse effects of vaccines nearly always occur within 2 months is because those vaccines were tested for years to avoid the long term effects.

A. Don't assume. *Especially for adults*, it's pretty much been this way for the entire history of vaccines (since 1900 with the completely untested smallpox, rabies, plague, cholera, and typhoid vaccines). If you have an adverse effect it will almost always happen within 2 months of vaccination. And today only a fraction of time of vaccine development is spent on human testing for long-term effects.

B. Testing for long term effects happens in Phase III testing, which typically lasts 1-3 years. It's been a year since Pfizer started Phase III testing, and the vaccine has been administered to a far wider sample size without discover of major long-term effects (at this point millions, vs the typical Phase III testing of \~1000), which greatly improves statistically confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ya I’m aware of that, I mentioned it. I just put it on my to do list to go get an antibody test

And you could test negative, get infected right after, and then go on to infect others.

&gt;reinfection has happened but isn’t common

We don't know how rare, and reinfection probability likely significantly increases over time. Plus the risk of reinfection is likely orders of magnitude higher than the risk of you experiencing some unknown long-term vaccine side-effect.

But IIRC some vaccines have shown slightly increased risks (albeit usually nonconclusive) associated with child development that have a longer onset (e.g. risk of diabetes at age 10 when immunized at birth), which you pretty much never see in adults. So even if that was a worry, it should not be for OP's case.

How can you say without discovery of long term effects when it’s only been a year?

What are you saying? It’s an antibody test? So if it’s negative, that would be a reason for me to get the vaccine? Obviously if it’s negative I could get reinfected???? Idk

&gt;How can you say without discovery of long term effects when it’s only been a year?

Because what really matters is sample size. Because spending a year testing for long-term effects is actually within normal vaccine development time ranges, especially since adverse effects always pop up in under 2 months from administration. How many vaccines have you heard of, *ever*, where a prevalent long-term effect was found with onset *years* after administration? The answer is zero. This might have been a valid concern 6 months ago, but it really isn't now.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;looks like at very worst 20% chance of reinfection

Your chances of experiencing a long-term side effect from a vaccine where none have been discovered during a year of Phase III trials and then subsequent deployment to 100s of millions is **exponentially less** (going off of the history of every other vaccine that's ever been developed).

2. Ya. It’s pretty all over the place but the worst I saw was 20% chance of reinfection. Do we even know if the vaccine will protect us from all these strains?

3. Ya I got that

4. This was the only point that was just me being like, I’m fine. If my argument is I don’t think I should get it, shouldn’t I probably consider my own health???

From what I’m seeing it doesn’t look like we’ll ever reach 75%, definitely not 85-95

I never said my age and health would prevent me from carrying. I was just saying I don’t have to worry about dying from it.

4 years in exploratory phase, 2 years in pre-clinical phase, 1-2 year for Phase I (initial human testing), 1-2 year for Phase II (testing people specific characteristics), 1-2 years for Phase III (testing a big sample size, usually \~1000-5000).

We've pretty quickly moved to Phase III, which has been going on for a year now. And the purpose of all the previous stages is to make sure nothing goes wrong in Phase III (and nothing really significant has, with a *massive* sample size). It's not like you'd catch more stuff as opposed to Phase III if you were in earlier phases for longer, it just makes it less risky to jump to a new phase. But Phase III has lasted for approx the normal length of time.

Reading others people’s posts on here, I think the consensus (in public opinion) is clear that you probably should get vaccinated if you’re able to.

That being said, here’s what the [BBC UK reported of risk-reward for the vaccine.](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/F3C8/production/_117880426_az_medium_risk_976-nc.png) As you can see, the benefits for an average person between 20-29 is marginal (hence why they receive vaccines last in the UK). 

For your age group, I understand that the benefits are marginal and there’s a (minimal) level of uncertainty around the vaccine. It has still undergone lots of trials thought, so you can’t dispute that these effects are minimal, if you do, then there’s not a discussion to be had. Moreover, I know that the risk for those in your age group may be predominantly marginal groups (like asthmatics / other underlying diseases). Additionally, there is a shortage of vaccines worldwide and many people you will come into contact with may not have had the vaccine (especially if you travel / live in a tourist area).

Nobody really has the authority to really tell you that you **have** to get the vaccine. If you don’t want to, that’s fine and justification enough. I can’t say it’s reasonable though, when you would benefit from it and so will others for a tiny level of risk. If you getting a vaccine would save 1 person from having 2-3 months in ICU, I’d argue it’s the moral thing to do. **You do you though**, if you don’t want to get vaccinated yet that’s completely your choice but you should own that rather than trying to find alternate justification.

You’re right, the government can / private entities can make it a barrier for entry or put it in your contract. Personally, I think mandating vaccines is government over-reach because your body isn’t their property, they shouldn’t be allowed to say you have to do X to it.
