## POST BODY
----------------------------------------
Beef tallow is everywhere. Online, in stores, maybe even in your cabinet. But where did it come from? Why did it suddenly rocket into popularity?


Let me break it down: 

For the longest time beef fat was just a byproduct that nobody wanted. Steaks were trimmed, roasts were rejected for being “too fatty”, heck, even the most popular version of ground beef is 80/20. Butchers and manufacturers couldn’t even give it away due to lack of demand. This was unacceptable! Big Beef can’t wring out every cent from consumers if they’re just throwing things away. Rising meat prices just weren’t enough to pad shareholders pockets. 

But someone, somewhere, got smart. 

Suddenly it’s repackaged as “beef tallow” and consumers can’t get enough! Beef tallow for cooking! Frying! Even skincare! The all natural solution to your every need! The word of beef tallow stretches into every genre of influencers online: cooking, homesteaders, trad-wives and beauty influencers alike tout this “organic miracle” on the algorithms of the general public. Now, not only is there purpose, but demand for discarded beef fat! I mean, all organic beef tallow. Actually, since it’s healthy and trendy let’s go ahead in charge 9-12 dollars a jar! 

So my theory is that Big Beef is doing what all companies do. Find and manipulate different ways of capturing the consumer in an increasingly convoluted market. Bonus points if you can use something you already had on hand, market it into something new and shiny, and infiltrate the social media sphere to push the word out. 

Signed- a marketing student. 

EDIT: Thank you all! My view has been changed, and I think I simply gave Big Beef too much credit as market manipulators 😂.

I'm a butcher. Tallow and fat are the same thing. It is butter and ghee, and your a dick for thinking that is a gotcha.

I own a deep fryer I use all the time. There is 0 difference in taste for anything I've tried, but the price is 3x per ml (I usually use peanut oil). I seriously doubt anyone will see any "health benefits" from the oil they fry with. Same thing with "pink Himalayan salt"; to get any benefits from that, youd have so eat so much you end up in the hospital.

&gt;Cottonseed is the best oil, but is rarely used even in the US. Its outright banned in Europe though. 

As far as I can see, cottonseed oil, or specifically, partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil is not recognized as safe either in the US or in the EU.

However, non-partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil is [sold and used in the EU](https://www.bonafideresearch.com/product/230929573/europe-cottonseed-oil-market#:~:text=Its%20neutral%20flavour%20allows%20the,Recent%20Product%20Launches:&amp;text=Vitality%20Oils%20Cottonseed%20Oil:%20This,specializes%20in%20cold%2Dpressed%20oils.&amp;text=Rapunzel%20Bio%20Cottonseed%20Oil:%20This,specializes%20in%20organic%20food%20products.&amp;text=Knorr%20Simply%20Olive%20&amp;%20Cottonseed%20Oil,British%20multinational%20consumer%20goods%20company) and in the US as well. 

  
This is true, frankly, of most things that are said to be "banned in the EU but legal in the US", where there are in fact similar regulations on foods as in the US and EU, but they are listed under different names so people do not know.

&gt;Any Hexane fraction

This does not seem to be true to me, given the following:

[https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/call/call-data-re-evaluation-technical-hexane-used-extraction-solvent-preparation-food-and-food#deadline-for-submission-of-data](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/call/call-data-re-evaluation-technical-hexane-used-extraction-solvent-preparation-food-and-food#deadline-for-submission-of-data)

The EU currently allows for hexane to be used as solvent, and they are actively researching if they should still do so (last they studied in 2024, they found it is still relatively safe to use).

Like I said, most people just operate on the assumption European Food standards are vastly different to the US, which is just not the case.

Exactly. As someone old enough to remember when McDonald's switched, it was noticeable. 

A similar thing has happened to chicken wings. I can remember them being 10 cents a pound.  Now they're so popular a pound of wings is the same price as a burger. 

The price adjusts based on demand.

That’s a very tall claim — what widely used frying oils are used in the US that are banned in the EU? 

Specifically, which oil, and how you’re quantifying that they’re widely used.

Tallow has been around a very long time, just like lard. McDonald’s used to use it in the 90s to fry their French fries at what might have been the height of their popularity. It didn’t come out of some marketing professionals head suddenly, it re-emerged as a function of changing product preferences. We are only a couple generations removed from every household having jars of bacon grease as a core pantry staple. 

With a rise in health consciousness and vegetarianism, the use of animal fats diminished. Now some are against seed oils and animal fats are re-emerging as viable alternatives. If there is a market and a moment for a product, who is to argue about it being sold. You could easily go make your own from beef fat, but most consumers don’t want the hassle of doing that.

You frame it very negatively but isn't it also good in a way? If the industry is creating more value from users from an animal it has already killed, is that not good in a way? 

If it is good, can we still call it propaganda?

Tallow is the rendered fat from any beef fat, not just suet.

Beef tallow has been made and used for such things for millennia, there's nothing new or innovative here, and no special effort I've seen from the beef industry. Though they're surely taking advantage of the fad however they can now.

Despite much effort to understand how and why fads happen, they remain a thing that *just happen*. I don't think the beef industry of all people have finally hacked our culture and successfully *caused* this. If they had, they or their hired consultants would be broadcasting and TEDtalking about it nonstop, because marketing people never stop marketing themselves

Yea I’ve seen this US vs EU debate parroted all over Reddit and once you dig into any specific examples it falls apart. 

Are there certain ingredients we’re consuming that are banned in EU, I’m sure that’s the case. But it becomes a much different argument when the add “widely used” to it.

No it's fucking not, suet is suet. Tallow is tallow. Some specific brand might only use suet in their tallow, but most tallow a normal person is gonna find is literally any rendered beef fat.

\&gt; Tallow and fat are the same thing.

Exactly.   Granted, tallow is a 'purified' version generally.  You can say "beef fat" and it's just a pile of the discarded fat bits from trimming beef.  Tallow is generally that same thing, but melted down and strained/purified to be more just pure fat.

&gt; We are only a couple generations removed from every household having jars of bacon grease as a core pantry staple.

My family gets a pig butchered every year from a local farmer/butcher. On the order sheet, I can elect to get the lard from it or not. It doesn’t change the price for me, but they will sell the lard at the butcher if I elect not to take it. The butcher doesn’t charge people like us for it because so many people will just not take the lard because they turn their nose up at it so they get a ton to sell to other customers. 

I also get usable organ tissues for making dogfood. 

It’s sad that a lot of people don’t realize we’ve used these products for a very long time and only recently has there been a push to waste half the carcass because of *modern sensibilities*.

I mean, tallow is rendered beef fat isn’t it? Took a by-product and altered it a bit to suit the market? Can’t just slap a label on a jar of beef fat BUT could maybe make people think it’s different if we do a little sprucing up.

I don’t think its a bad thing. I just think from a marketing point of view it’s an interesting push that’s come to be. I think propaganda can be used for good or bad tbh. But it doesn’t negate the fact it’s propaganda.

### OP Reply #4 | Score: -1
----------------------------------------
For me, “propaganda” can include so many things. Propaganda is used to make people lean one side over the other (traditionally) or to hold a belief that one thing is better. “X brand is the best!” “Y brand doesn’t stand a chance” rings the same as “X army is the best!” Just on a smaller scale with smaller impact.

### OP Reply #5 | Score: 3
----------------------------------------
I think the difference for me was not only were they promoting beef tallow, but they are also “putting down” any other form of oil or the like. “Beef tallow is great! XYX oil is bad and scary!” Moving it from promotion territory by scare tactic.
