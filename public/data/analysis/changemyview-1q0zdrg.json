Cultures from today don’t look anything like they did 50 years ago regardless of multiculturalism. \n\nEven in homogeneous societies, cultures change and diversify. You really can’t argue otherwise. So what then becomes the common factor that you believe is bad? It’s not the culture, it’s diversity. You don’t think culture change is bad, you’re arguing that diversity is bad and centering it on culture that changes regardless of diversity of population. \n\nBut diversity alone doesn’t inherently change culture. And in many more diverse counties, their diverse populations assimilated to common shared culture. A culture where it’s harder to define the hard lines between various cultures as they begin to blend together into a shared culture.",

Almost no war in human history has had culture as the primary factor for its inception. \n\nAccording to you, there should be no war between Latin American countries in the past 200 years since independence since they all share a national hispanic “monoculture”, and are largely made up of one mestizo “race” and only continue to homogenize with time. And yet these nations have been fighting one another for a long long time. The gran chaco war, The War of the Pacific, The Paraguayan war etc. They’ve fought eachother for power and influence and to advance their own national interests, these wars have had nothing to do with culture. \n\nThe same is true for the World Wars, there is nothing inherent about German culture being naturally “more milataristic”, and therefore they started the second world war and helped start the first. No, World War I was simply a result of the concert of Europe reaching the natural conclusion of a world order based on a balance of powers rather than treaties and mutual cooperation. World War II was the Nazis taking advantage of the anger of the German people to rile them up and getting them to blame Communists, Jews, and any and all minorities who weren’t the ideal “Aryan” race. \n\nCan you name a single conflict for me that truly has culture as its primary motivator? \n\nEven the Russo-Ukranian war is Putin using the cultural similarity of Ukraine and Russia as a justification for his desire to restore Russia to the Soivet Union’s geopolitical influence across Europe. \n\nAnd even then, according to what you said Ukraine and Russia have no reason to fight because they share a near-identical culture with a near-identical church, so how could they ever end up fighting under your framework? Same with Taiwan and China, they have no reason to fight because of their similiar culture, and yet it’s one of the US’s primary political concerns for a reason. \n\nAll in all your view is that of cultural determinism, and I would challenge that strongly and say no actually wars happen because leaders think they can gain something from a war or they want vengeance for past grievances, no leader thinks, “ah I can’t understand what these people are saying, they’re too different from us, we have to invade them.” Less unique cultures in this world is just an objective bad, less wars will not come from less cultures, the only reason we have less war in the modern era is the proliferation of democracy across the world and the undisputed dominance of the United States as the #1 superpower, it has nothing to do with culture.",

If it’s culture based and its arabs vs jews then why is it only Iran that actually opposes Isreal, meanwhile Egypt closes their border to Palestinian refugees. \n\nThe only people who are primarily concerned with the defence of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are concerned Westerners and The Palestinians themselves because its their own self-interest. If it was truly a “clash of cultures” then why doesn’t the entire arab world unite against Isreal and sanction them? Obviously they won’t because it’s in their interest to play ball with Isreal for their own economies and to keep the U.S. happy. Culture is secondary to geopolitcal interests.",

CON only needs to refute this by showing alternative explanations or challenging the causal link. Presumption favors CON because the status quo assumes cultural change is natural and multifaceted, not primarily caused by globalization/immigration. While PRO won some issues (Historical Cases 9/10, Immigration and Identity 5/10), these weren't sufficient to establish clear causation. CON successfully reframed cultural change as natural evolution and won the most critical issues: Natural Cultural Evolution (10/10) and Nature of Cultural Change (9/10). CON met their burden by providing compelling alternative explanations that undermined PRO's causal claim, while PRO failed to definitively prove that globalization/immigration are the primary drivers of indigenous cultural loss rather than contributors to natural cultural evolution."
