If that is constant, why wouldn't things just always cost infinite money... Also did... Every single business owner and board get together and collude to raise prices all at the exact same time every time prices increase? Across every industry? If so, why raise prices right now? Why not last week or just every day from now on forever?\n\nIt's such a frustrating argument because a. I 100% agree companies, and particularly corporations, are ruthless, money making machines that operate at maximum greed at all times and b. It has nothing to do with the overall cost of things.  It also offers effectively no solution because if the problem is insurmountable human nature, you can't force people to suddenly become altruistic.  It's just the easy emotional response to prices people don't like and is always followed up with just 'tax companies more' (which is always wild to me because is... The greedy company just going to eat that loss of profit or pass that onto the consumer...) or price controls which will get me started on an entirely different rant  I don't need to go on right now.",

Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude strongly that lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, will lower the incidence of CVD.",

Podcast bros (Joe Rogan, Adam Carolla, Theo Von, et al) platformed and promoted these views for years. RFK and MAHA are the current culmination of this movement.
