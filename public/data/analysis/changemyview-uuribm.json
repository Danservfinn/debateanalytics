If a resident but noncitizen gets pregnant, do they immediately have an American citizen inside them that can't be forced to leave the country?\n\nIt's lunacy philosophically as well. If we define a person as nothing more than a unique DNA strand with living cells, well, that's the most dehumanizing thing I've ever heard of. It takes more than just the basic building blocks to truly BE a person.\n\nPlus, not once in any of our other laws and consideration is anyone ever obligated to keep *someone else* alive through the use of *their body's tissues.* It just doesn't happen.

PRO bears the burden to prove logical inconsistency exists. However, PRO failed to meet this burden - they won only one low-weight issue (3/10) while CON won all major issues including 'External Effects of Personal Choices' (10/10) and 'Scope and Limits of Bodily Autonomy' (9/10). CON successfully demonstrated that bodily autonomy principles can consistently include limitations when actions affect others' health, distinguishing abortion (primarily self-affecting) from vaccine refusal (affecting community health). CON met their burden by effectively refuting PRO's hypocrisy claim through showing these positions operate on different principles and contexts."
