      "selftext": "Alright I’m done replying. Thank you everyone for your posts. \n\n**My takeaways:**\n+ I had not thought about all the people who simply cannot get the vaccine, due to medical or other reasons.\n+ I have a better understanding of the normal 10-15 year vaccine process and how we’re following the same process (currently on Phase 3), but skipping those first 2-4 years that a normal vaccine has to go through, primarily because of money.\n+ We have a long ways to go for herd immunity.\n+ Some of y’all are insecure wolves. God damn. A man simply questions the status quo and all of a sudden I’m selfish, dumb, an asshole, what’s wrong with society, don’t care about anyone besides the people I know, etc. \n\n**My consensus:**\nI don’t like the societal and governmental pressure. I don’t like people telling me I’m an idiot for thinking this way. I don’t like the government threatening to restrict my life if I don’t get it. I don’t like not having a choice. It’s those kind of things that make me want to resist. And when I’m nervous or uncomfortable about something as it is, then have to deal with all the pressure on top of it... I mean y’all gotta empathize for how that feels, and how it effects your decision making.\n\nThe best reason I heard was the people who cannot get vaccinated. There’s no answer for them other than others getting vaccinated. I don’t think we have any fuckin chance of hitting the required herd immunity levels, so honestly that’s not a factor here. I’m not as concerned about the vaccine anymore. I really do not think I can get infected again, just based on how much I’ve been in packed bars this year. I guess I could have gotten it and been asymptomatic again, but I prolly woulda infected someone? Idk.\n\nI’m going to get an antibody test this week, just out of curiosity. Then I think next week I’ll get the vaccine. I’m gonna give it till next week just so I can make sure I’m comfortable with it before doing it.\n\nTo all those with the condescending, dickhead comments, trying to guilt me into it, or just make me feel bad, you did nothing to sway me. To those that took your time giving me good information, and were empathetic to my situation, or at least neutral, thank you.\n\nHappy Tuesday y’all\n- Pickle Rick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince I keep getting the same responses! These are the points of the reasons\n+ Reason 1: Why I don’t want to, or am wary of, getting it.\n+ Reason 2: Why I don’t think I’ll be a risk to others.\n+ Reason 3: Why I think others will be protected.\n+ **Reason 4: Why I don’t need it, personally, my well-being. Stop commenting about this one. Obviously it’s a point completely concerned with myself. I literally said, “not a main reason at all”. If I’m deciding to get the vaccine, shouldn’t I consider my own health? Ffs focus on the other 3 points**\n\nHere me out.\n\nSo I’m still on the fence about getting it, but right now I do not want to get it. I would love to hear people out though. Two weeks ago I was scheduled to get it, started stressing, and reached out to a bunch of friends to see what they were doing.\n\nTo my surprise, hardly any of my 25ish circle of friends are getting vaccinated. I only know of 2 of them that are. And only 3 of us believe crazy conspiracies (they’re all morons). I really don’t think any of the 4 reasons stated below falls under crazy propaganda or conspiracy. The main reasons for my friends and I not getting it are:\n\n**1) We don’t know the long term effects.**\n\nIts a very new vaccine that didn’t get the [normal 10-15 years of testing](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation) that every other vaccine gets. There is no denying that there was a huge rush to get these developed. Yes I know there was a global pandemic so obviously a rush. However, and I promise this is my only political point, but there was also a massive financial motive to get it done ASAP. Pfizer and Moderna are projected to make [$30 billion in vaccine sales this year.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/11/business/pfizer-vaccine-covid-moderna-revenue/index.html) They would not have made anything if they delayed to perform testing for another year. All of the vaccine companies were in a race with each other to see who could get it done first. Sorry, but you are simply naive if you think the pandemic and global health was the ONLY motive for their rush. The long term effects is a genuine concern I have, and makes me really uncomfortable to get it.\n\nI will say, half of my friends that I asked said they just wanna wait to see how it goes with everyone else. I kinda feel the same way, we’re just uncomfortable with it. However, none of us actually have any idea how long that wait is gonna be. I’d wager majority who said that just end up never getting it.\n\n*If you try to make some argument about the yearly flu vaccines, you have no idea how vaccines work. Source: 2 genius doctors in my family (who are both very pro vaccine).*\n\n**2) Antibodies. My friends and I have all had it.**\n\nOkay so the data on this varies. A [quick google search ](https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+reinfection+rate&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari)  you can see 10+ different articles. At very worst, it’s looking like a 20% chance of reinfection. At very best less than 1%, but I doubt that.\n\n**3) Every single at risk person I know is vaccinated.**\n\nMy parents and grandparents, my friends parents, etc. They should be protected right? Over 60% of the country (US) has already gotten at least their first shot. And it’s soooo easy to get a shot these days, anyone who’s really worried about their health has no excuse not to have it. \n\nInformation about the vaccine efficacy rates vary. This is from [Pfizer’s](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious) website: \n\n*”Vaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 95.3% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration”*\n\n**4) I’m healthy and was asymptotic.**\n\nNot a main reason at all. But I’m 26, healthy, and had 0 symptoms when I got infected. Only reason I got tested was because my roommates had it.\n\n\nIf you combine:\n+ Majority of people are vaccinated\n+ The likelihood that we have proper antibodies\n+ My age and health\n+ All the masks, social distancing, etc\n\n\nThen:\n1. I feel confident that my loved ones are safe. \n2. I don’t see why I need to take on the risk when we don’t know the long-term effects.\n3. I don’t see how me getting the vaccine will make an impact on society or the pandemic.\n\nLet me be clear, I’m really not anti-vax. I don’t think people are sheep for getting it. I don’t think of anyone any differently if they get it. I think our doctors and scientists probably did a great job in developing these vaccines. I’ve been for the masks the whole time. It’s simply that given the 4 reasons I stated above, I am not comfortable, nor do I feel a moral obligation, to get it.\n\nAnd if anyone thinks it’s because of my political views, 15-20 of us are democrats, including myself.
