    "subreddit": "changemyview",
    "selftext": "Alright I\u2019m done replying. Thank you everyone for your posts. \n\n**My takeaways:**\n+ I had not thought about all the people who simply cannot get the vaccine, due to medical or other reasons.\n+ I have a better understanding of the normal 10-15 year vaccine process and how we\u2019re following the same process (currently on Phase 3), but skipping those first 2-4 years that a normal vaccine has to go through, primarily because of money.\n+ We have a long ways to go for herd immunity.\n+ Some of y\u2019all are insecure wolves. God damn. A man simply questions the status quo and all of a sudden I\u2019m selfish, dumb, an asshole, what\u2019s wrong with society, don\u2019t care about anyone besides the people I know, etc. \n\n**My consensus:**\nI don\u2019t like the societal and governmental pressure. I don\u2019t like people telling me I\u2019m an idiot for thinking this way. I don\u2019t like the government threatening to restrict my life if I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t like not having a choice. It\u2019s those kind of things that make me want to resist. And when I\u2019m nervous or uncomfortable about something as it is, then have to deal with all the pressure on top of it... I mean y\u2019all gotta empathize for how that feels, and how it effects your decision making.\n\nThe best reason I heard was the people who cannot get vaccinated. There\u2019s no answer for them other than others getting vaccinated. I don\u2019t think we have any fuckin chance of hitting the required herd immunity levels, so honestly that\u2019s not a factor here. I\u2019m not as concerned about the vaccine anymore. I really do not think I can get infected again, just based on how much I\u2019ve been in packed bars this year. I guess I could have gotten it and been asymptomatic again, but I prolly woulda infected someone? Idk.\n\nI\u2019m going to get an antibody test this week, just out of curiosity. Then I think next week I\u2019ll get the vaccine. I\u2019m gonna give it till next week just so I can make sure I\u2019m comfortable with it before doing it.\n\nTo all those with the condescending, dickhead comments, trying to guilt me into it, or just make me feel bad, you did nothing to sway me. To those that took your time giving me good information, and were empathetic to my situation, or at least neutral, thank you.\n\nHappy Tuesday y\u2019all\n- Pickle Rick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince I keep getting the same responses! These are the points of the reasons\n+ Reason 1: Why I don\u2019t want to, or am wary of, getting it.\n+ Reason 2: Why I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be a risk to others.\n+ Reason 3: Why I think others will be protected.\n+ **Reason 4: Why I don\u2019t need it, personally, my well-being. Stop commenting about this one. Obviously it\u2019s a point completely concerned with myself. I literally said, \u201cnot a main reason at all\u201d. If I\u2019m deciding to get the vaccine, shouldn\u2019t I consider my own health? Ffs focus on the other 3 points**\n\nHere me out.\n\nSo I\u2019m still on the fence about getting it, but right now I do not want to get it. I would love to hear people out though. Two weeks ago I was scheduled to get it, started stressing, and reached out to a bunch of friends to see what they were doing.\n\nTo my surprise, hardly any of my 25ish circle of friends are getting vaccinated. I only know of 2 of them that are. And only 3 of us believe crazy conspiracies (they\u2019re all morons). I really don\u2019t think any of the 4 reasons stated below falls under crazy propaganda or conspiracy. The main reasons for my friends and I not getting it are:\n\n**1) We don\u2019t know the long term effects.**\n\nIts a very new vaccine that didn\u2019t get the [normal 10-15 years of testing](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation) that every other vaccine gets. There is no denying that there was a huge rush to get these developed. Yes I know there was a global pandemic so obviously a rush. However, and I promise this is my only political point, but there was also a massive financial motive to get it done ASAP. Pfizer and Moderna are projected to make [$30 billion in vaccine sales this year.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/11/business/pfizer-vaccine-covid-moderna-revenue/index.html) They would not have made anything if they delayed to perform testing for another year. All of the vaccine companies were in a race with each other to see who could get it done first. Sorry, but you are simply naive if you think the pandemic and global health was the ONLY motive for their rush. The long term effects is a genuine concern I have, and makes me really uncomfortable to get it.\n\nI will say, half of my friends that I asked said they just wanna wait to see how it goes with everyone else. I kinda feel the same way, we\u2019re just uncomfortable with it. However, none of us actually have any idea how long that wait is gonna be. I\u2019d wager majority who said that just end up never getting it.\n\n*If you try to make some argument about the yearly flu vaccines, you have no idea how vaccines work. Source: 2 genius doctors in my family (who are both very pro vaccine).*\n\n**2) Antibodies. My friends and I have all had it.**\n\nOkay so the data on this varies. A [quick google search ](https://www.google.com/search?q=covid+reinfection+rate&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari)  you can see 10+ different articles. At very worst, it\u2019s looking like a 20% chance of reinfection. At very best less than 1%, but I doubt that.\n\n**3) Every single at risk person I know is vaccinated.**\n\nMy parents and grandparents, my friends parents, etc. They should be protected right? Over 60% of the country (US) has already gotten at least their first shot. And it\u2019s soooo easy to get a shot these days, anyone who\u2019s really worried about their health has no excuse not to have it. \n\nInformation about the vaccine efficacy rates vary. This is from [Pfizer\u2019s](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-confirm-high-efficacy-and-no-serious) website: \n\n*\u201dVaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 95.3% effective in preventing severe disease as defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u201d*\n\n**4) I\u2019m healthy and was asymptotic.**\n\nNot a main reason at all. But I\u2019m 26, healthy, and had 0 symptoms when I got infected. Only reason I got tested was because my roommates had it.\n\n\nIf you combine:\n+ Majority of people are vaccinated\n+ The likelihood that we have proper antibodies\n+ My age and health\n+ All the masks, social distancing, etc\n\n\nThen:\n1. I feel confident that my loved ones are safe. \n2. I don\u2019t see why I need to take on the risk when we don\u2019t know the long-term effects.\n3. I don\u2019t see how me getting the vaccine will make an impact on society or the pandemic.\n\nLet me be clear, I\u2019m really not anti-vax. I don\u2019t think people are sheep for getting it. I don\u2019t think of anyone any differently if they get it. I think our doctors and scientists probably did a great job in developing these vaccines. I\u2019ve been for the masks the whole time. It\u2019s simply that given the 4 reasons I stated above, I am not comfortable, nor do I feel a moral obligation, to get it.\n\nAnd if anyone thinks it\u2019s because of my political views, 15-20 of us are democrats, including myself. Fuck Trump.\n\nGive me your worst Reddit.\n\n*Edit for formatting",
