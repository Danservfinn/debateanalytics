      "selftext": "Beef tallow is everywhere. Online, in stores, maybe even in your cabinet. But where did it come from? Why did it suddenly rocket into popularity?\n\n\nLet me break it down: \n\nFor the longest time beef fat was just a byproduct that nobody wanted. Steaks were trimmed, roasts were rejected for being “too fatty”, heck, even the most popular version of ground beef is 80/20. Butchers and manufacturers couldn’t even give it away due to lack of demand. This was unacceptable! Big Beef can’t wring out every cent from consumers if they’re just throwing things away. Rising meat prices just weren’t enough to pad shareholders pockets. \n\nBut someone, somewhere, got smart. \n\nSuddenly it’s repackaged as “beef tallow” and consumers can’t get enough! Beef tallow for cooking! Frying! Even skincare! The all natural solution to your every need! The word of beef tallow stretches into every genre of influencers online: cooking, homesteaders, trad-wives and beauty influencers alike tout this “organic miracle” on the algorithms of the general public. Now, not only is there purpose, but demand for discarded beef fat! I mean, all organic beef tallow. Actually, since it’s healthy and trendy let’s go ahead in charge 9-12 dollars a jar! \n\nSo my theory is that Big Beef is doing what all companies do. Find and manipulate different ways of capturing the consumer in an increasingly convoluted market. Bonus points if you can use something you already had on hand, market it into something new and shiny, and infiltrate the social media sphere to push the word out. \n\nSigned- a marketing student. \n\nEDIT: Thank you all! My view has been changed, and I think I simply gave Big Beef too much credit as market manipulators 😂. ",
